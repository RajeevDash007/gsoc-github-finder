          "description": "The Arctic sea is a framework for developing OGC services, clients and middleware sharing concepts for encoding and decoding of different formats and encodings, workflows and configuration. It is the backbone for OGC services, clients and middleware.\n\t\tOne of the important components of the Arctic Sea framework is Faroe. Faroe is a configuration API currently featuring a JSON and a SQLite backend. It enables the injection and automatic configuration of settings of various types in classes, including a Spring BeanPostprocessor. It allows us to set properties for OGC services. \n\tThe problem statement thus asks to create a web frontend to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) the JSON settings with a REST API on top of faroe API. I will try to develop a user-friendly UI for the same and make sure CRUD operations are carried out properly through UI, making it extensible and customizable. Also I’ll try to surely implement the optional extension mentioned in the problem statement.",

The goal of this project is to extend the capabilities of ScanCode license detection to include licenses that are external to LicenseDB, such as proprietary licenses to be kept within an organization.\n\nThe two main components of my approach are adding a new command line option and creating license index caches for these external licenses. The new command line option will enable the user to specify the directories of the licenses and rules that they’d like to use.\n\nThe second part of the approach is modifying ScanCode toolkit internals to work with this new command line option, and to handle the creation and maintenance of indexes for any new license sets.

However, some of the new issues came across that need to be addressed such as the expiration of manifest v2, an empty Django backend page, and single-browser supportability. I plan on improving the UI so that it will become more innovative and user-friendly, injecting the button feature in the Google Scholar page for direct navigation to an author's profile page, integrating extension with typescript, adding cross-browser compatibility and new metrics indexes, transitioning chrome extension to manifest v3, and providing dark mode and an option to toggle between light and dark themes. I also plan to make the codebase more polished by replacing javascript dom functions with jQuery and creating a login/signup page for enrolling new users. Besides this, I will also be maintaining detailed documentation on CI/CD integration testing, gulp automation workflow, and various test cases for making it useful to the new developers.",

          "description": "The basic features in an Election DApp are user registration, election creation, voting and result calculation. To make our DApp more flexible and user friendly, we need to add more voting algorithms apart from General Voting Algorithm. The three important features that need to be implemented are 1) Open and Invite based elections. 2) Authentication and user KYC. 3) Multiple algorithms to conduct elections. To implement these features, I would first work on the algorithms which will be written in Solidity. The front-end part will use Reactjs. For KYC verification, I'll use IPFS to store the document and encrypt the file. The admins can decrypt the file when verifying. This process of encryption, decryption and verification can be handled using Solidity.  There is also an option to create open elections or invite-based. Invite-based elections can be done using EmailJS and SendGrid to send the election link to the email. Since these links can be shared, there will be a check to ensure that only the invited voter is voting. To increase user engagement, we will provide a domain `abc.voter` to get them identified as a voter for using our platform. This domain will also mint an NFT and the voter now has it. There are several other features that I would add such as \"Extend Election Dates\", \"Restrict Past Dates\", \"Logout functionality\", \"Profile Edit\", and \"Improve the UI\".",

But in reality, production environment exceptional logs are not known in advance and users can't enumerate all possible exceptional logs. This task aims to add an algorithm that can identify outlier log(s) from the massive logs, and draw the users attention to see whether there is error in the system. Log acquisition, log analysis, feature extraction, and anomaly detection are the four aspects of this algorithm. To extract the relevant features in log events, the feature extraction technique divides the log data set into finite blocks using a window. A representative approach of supervised learning is used to execute the final anomaly detection process (SVM). The algorithm should be able to learn from bot the history logs and streaming logs, and adjust itself to increase the accuracy.",

          "description": "ShenYu is a widely used program for limiting, fusing, forwarding, routing, monitoring, and so on. Since ShenYu clusters are able to support a large volume of internet business, it is crucial to decouple the systems and data streams. The Kafka plugins as a high-throughput distributed messaging system will enable ShenYu to have excellent horizontal scalability, scaling to millions of messages per second. It enables the data stream to communicate with less than 10 ms latency, almost real-time message transmission. In this feature, the logging-Kafka plugin will be able to store ShenYu’s logs and take the ShenYu gateway log information, write it to Kafka and display it. The module could be activated as a “Shenyu-plugin”.",

At present, this parser engine can handle SQLs for MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, openGauss and Oracle. However, there are still many statements that are not supported yet.\n\nTherefore this project proposes to Solve unsupported Postgres sql about alter statements for ShardingSphere parser and also proofread and optimize the grammar wherever needed.\n\nThis project would require to proofread through DDLStatement.g4 to analyze existing grammars and optimize them (essential), write grammar for unsupported alter statements referring to the official PostgreSQL documentation (essential), implement visit methods for the statements (essential), add new corresponding SQL cases  and expected parsed results (essential), Run SQLParserParameterizedTest and UnsupportedSQLParserParameterizedTest to make sure there are no exceptions (essential).\n\nSuccessful Implementation of the project will add proper support for PostgreSQL Alter Statements ensuring there are no exceptions for the following statements,  ALTER OPERATOR, ALTER POLICY, ALTER PUBLICATION, ALTER ROUTINE, ALTER RULE, ALTER SCHEMA, ALTER SEQUENCE, ALTER SERVER, ALTER STATISTICS, ALTER SUBSCRIPTION, ALTER TABLE, ALTER TEXT SEARCH,ALTER TRIGGER, ALTER TYPE, ALTER VIEW.\n\nThis project will significantly improve the ShardingSphere parser engine.",

An active health check provided by Envoy removes unhealthy instances immediately and then joins the service route when the instance is healthy again. However, the readinessProbe implementation provided by Dubbo does not apply to mesh.

But the methods laid during this project should be transferable to the other vehicle types. There are multiple-step I identified to achieve this goal. Firstly, the ArduCopter attitude controller code structure needs to be changed to allow running custom controller concurrently and safely switching between two-controller. Second, a hook in ArduCopter for Simulink code generation to bind should be created. Third, human-readable source code from Simulink without any dependencies on the Matlab libraries should be generated. Fourth, prepare a Matlab script to automatically merge generated libraries into ArduCopter source code, and configure and build it. Last, prepare detailed documentation and video to show how to utilize this functionality.",

          "description": "ArduPilot is the most advanced autopilot software capable of controlling numerous vehicles such as Copters, Planes, Rovers, Boats, etc. It comes with highly advanced and customisable features. This project proposal is based on implementing a feature named AutoDocking on rovers.\nWith autodocking feature, we would be able to automatically park a rover at a docking station. This would reduce the efforts of the pilot to manually drive and park the vehicle at the desired location.\nI propose to implement this feature with the help of a camera sensor attached to a companion computer which would help us track the dock and transmit relevant mavlink messages to the vehicle. These mavlink messages will be used at the vehicle end to estimate the precise position of the docking target and maneuver the rover towards it.",

It’s the foundation of the openBIM workflow. Today, IFC is most often used as a software-agnostic way of exchanging building information, but there is increasing interest in using the IFC schema as the native format for working with BIM data.\n\n\nBlender, with its mature modelling and rendering capabilities, has the potential to become a powerful BIM authoring tool. Open data and integrated python console already give many options for customising the data and meta data of any geometric object. The BlenderBIM plugin introduces the possibility to assign the properties of IFC classes to native blender geometry and export correctly structured IFC files through the use of the IfcOpenShell software library that already contains many useful functions to work with the IFC schema.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a plugin for the visual scripting language for Blender, Sverchok, that would enable creating IFC geometry and data through the visual programming nodes, allowing the users to create their own parametric workflows and incorporate IFC data directly into their design process.\n\n\nAn equivalent plugin for Sverchok, would allow an integrated parametric design and native IFC workflow to be completed fully inside the FOSS environment. It would also be a strong foundation for integrations with other Building Performance Simulations (BPS) tools. Integration and porting of the nodes to FreeCAD would also be possible.\n\n\nSome of the basic nodes are already coded under the IfcSverchok project. The work will involve testing the existing nodes and writing many more to support the full use case. Since the IFC schema is very large, and often difficult to grasp for new users, emphasis will be on integrating the concepts of IFC into a typical design process in a natural manner and communicating the relevant information comprehensively to the user.",

          "description": "Casbin-dashboard is the official web UI (admin portal) for Casbin models and policies. Casdoor is a centralized authentication / Single-Sign-On (SSO) platform.\nProblem: \n1. A more friendly policy management UI is needed for Casbin-dashboard. And it should be able to handle 10,000+ more rules. 2. Test management page needs to be developed for Casbin-dashboard. A test page to make example requests to Casbin and get responses, like Postman. 3. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. Of course authorization will be implemented in Casbin. 4. Casdoor needs to sign up with email without verification by configuring the application edit page. 5. Casdoor needs to support configurable captcha in user flows. It can support different implementations.\nSolution:\n1. We can use more powerful and high-quality UI libraries such as Ant Design to build more friendly web UI. And in order to handle 10,000+ more rules, we can use paging display and virtual list in frontend, and we can use paging query and database index in backend. 2. We can build a test management page, so that we can create and edit our unit test case through the web page. 3. We can build an authorization management page to realize the authorization of the dashboard. We can use Casbin models to control the presentation of every element on the page and control each request of the RESTful API. 4. We can add a rule to control whether the email verification is required.5. We can integrate the different services from cloud captcha providers like gCaptcha, hCaptcha. To save a lot of work, we just only need to integrate the wrapper code.\nDeliverables:\n1. Allow to sign up with Email without verification for Casdoor. - June 7; \n2. Support configurable captcha for Casdoor. - June 28; \n3. A more friendly policy management UI for Casbin-dashboard. - July 11; \n4. Test management page for Casbin-dashboard. - July 23; \n5. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. - Aug 11;",

          "description": "Currently, Casbin uses golang built-in map structure to maintain policies in the main memory and persist the policies via adapter abstraction.\n\nIf policies data grows, however, the growing cost of main memory resources and bad performance make the memory management strategy not tolerable anymore. We need to find a better way to manage the casbin in-memory data when data grows.\n\nFrom my point of view, our main goal is to reduce the cost of memory as well as keep good performance handling policies read and write requests.\n\nIn order to achieve those key goals, we can introduce an experimental tuple storage to get charge of storing those policies, turning the policies management strategy from memory-oriented to disk-oriented. We can even make a better abstraction of the storage layer so that we can use different engines (row, column) for the different workloads.\n\nIn general, we can take the following parts into consideration to achieve our goals.  \n    1. API for upper layer.\n    2. workload optimizer. \n    3. Buffer Pool management.\n    4. Indexing.\n    5. Data Storage Structures.\n    6.

Carefully designed API for upper Casbin internal module.\n    2. Storage management. Include file organization and page layout.\n    3. Buffer pool management.\n    4. Index management.\n    5.

For a tri-state multiplexer, we will use tristate for each D FlipFlop because this will use the same data line throughout the array of DFFs for easier and better routing.

And this project I am going to add the Asynchronous I/O.\n\nThe plan to solve it:\nMilestone 1: create a new Python API.\nMilestone 2: convert existing c tests to python tests.\nMilestone 3: test my implementation with the tests.\nMilestone 4: evaluate the performance with a scientific python application.\nWhen all tests pass we will have a usable Python interface for the asynchronous I/O.\n\nAn example: the H5Fcreate_async function:\nFirst, prepare the H5Fcreate_async.h file, H5Fcreate_async.c file, and we create the cyH5Fcreate_async.pyx file. \nSecond, use the command to Parse pyx source code into c code. \nNext, use some commands to compile c files into object files (*.o files)\nNext, use some commands to link multiple object files into dynamic link library files (*.so files)\nIn this way, the file of H5Fcreate_async.so is obtained, and then the library can be imported in the Python application.",

This will allow mentors in slack to have one go-to point for all of the most common issues that they can refer to.  \n\n\nAll of the tutorials and demos are text + screenshots posted on GitHub. This is because it’s easier to update them when new versions of software come out or if the existing guide does not cover a particular topic. Videos get outdated every 3-6 months and require an effort from contributors to support.

Currently, we are developing a fast inference system in TMVA, called SOFIE, that takes takes ONNX model as input and produces compilation-ready standalone C++ scripts as output. These scripts will then provide users an easy way to deploy their deep learning models in their physics software and analysis frameworks.\n\nThis project will focus on development of some missing deep learning operations which will allow to build more complex networks within TMVA. Specifically, we propose to implement the inference functionality of some ONNX operators in the code generation format. The student can choose to build this based on existing implementations in TMVA or other existing machine learning software tools or build their own from scratch. The expected result is a working implementation of modular operators classes that implement the operators as defined by the ONNX standards in the code generation format.

This software, developed over the past decade by hundreds of physicists, is constantly evolving to optimize the algorithms for better physics performance and resource efficiency. \n\nGiven the size, diversity and dynamic nature of the development team, quality assurance of the software is a big challenge. Belle II Software has had several monitoring schemes implemented so far, along with a high-level validation tool. This tool runs on existing large datasets producing distribution plots of quantities relevant for physics analyses and displaying the results on a webpage. This project aims to improve this validation tool. Bookkeeping of known issues detected by the tool, along with improved logging and integration with the issue tracking system can help fast track root cause analyses. The plots generated can also display more relevant information, and point toward the datasets used to encourage the reuse of common artefacts. \n\nThe plan is to enhance the user experience of the Belle II software validation tool and make workflows more efficient with appropriate technical solutions. We will start with integrating the issue tracking system with the validation tool, to better track the history of degradations. The plotting module will be overhauled to include relevant software information, as well as hyperlinks to make them self-sufficient. Enhancements to the logging module to have better logs attached directly to the issues from the validation tool to fast track issue debugging. The common artefacts will be pooled together in a manner allowing for easy reference from plots, logs and issues and also to prevent regeneration overheads.

Currently, Phoenix as a project comprises 3 packages: phoenix-event-display, phoenix-ui-components, and phoenix-app. \n\nAnd, my goal is to set new benchmarks and coverage thresholds for these 3 packages that will essentially, enforce and encourage testing for the whole of the project with Behavior-driven Development as its sole motivation so that potential issues that may occur in a critical environment can be identified much before they happen. This can effectively help us to troubleshoot problems and bugs so that the changes that will be made in the future to the codebase can be deemed reliable.",

Augur and Grimoirelab are two powerful open source community health analytics projects supporting the CHAOSS mission. In particular, each has implementation of select metrics based on an expanding set of implementation-agnostic metric definitions associated with various focus areas.\n\nThe CHAOSS Metrics Model Working group defines metric models, which integrate multiple CHAOSS metrics in a way that makes it easy for end users such as community managers to get a more comprehensive measure of an open source community. Currently, Conversion Rate can be defined as a metric or metric model. It measures the rates at which new contributors to an open source project move through the \"contributor funnel\" toward sustained contribution and/or community maintainership. There is no implementation of the Conversion Rate metric or metric model in CHAOSS software yet.\n\nThis project aims to build a novel implementation of Conversion Rate as a metric model that is based on a minimum number of atomic metrics and has maximum reuse of existing implemented metrics as well as common metric model calculation code supporting all types of conversion rates. A simple config file based UI for entering parameters and filters by the users is all it takes to run the metric model. \n\nNew metrics will be implemented first in Jupyter Notebook as reference code and can later migrate into Grimoirelab backend (for sharing with future new metric models or reports) along with data collection and enrichment extensions. The Metric Model calculation code and methods, and a common visualization interface will be also implemented in Jupyter Notebook, followed by a deployment with OpenSearch Dashboards visualization.",

This project aims to make various improvements to the LLD linker, which will ultimately improve user experience and allow Chromium developers to be more productive.\n\nI plan to focus on two key areas: performance, and quality of diagnostics. While LLD is regarded as a faster alternative to system linkers, the new mold linker has shown that there are still speed gains to be had. My work will include bringing parallelism to the construction of various linker-synthesized sections in the Mach-O port, and to input file reading. Regarding diagnostics, I’m going to implement deduplication for “undefined symbol” errors in the Mach-O port and utilize debug information to show where duplicate symbols are defined.

It offers near native performance in a browser and is meant to not be a hand written language but to be the compilation target of source languages like C, C++, Rust etc. It provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so. It, being a new language , does not enjoy wide support across platforms. The prospect of having a unified interface for web developers has long been elusive. It has the potential to provide the basis on which many apps can be built and deployed for a huge range of devices from IoT devices to fully fledged servers. But to enable developers to use it we need a WASI runtime ecosystem to support them. WasmEdge is one such project that aims to bring WebAssembly to the edge.\n\nTo provide  a unified  interface accross multiple platforms, a interface between WasmEdge and the host operating system has to be built. This interface is specific to the platform on which the runtime is deployed and has to be built individually and specifically for each platform bearing in mind the features available. The native API provided by the OS should be used to implement many of the common operations like file manipulation, IO etc. These 'host functions' are crucial for the project to succeed and have been defined in WASI - the Web Assembly System Interface which is a modular collection of standardised APIs\n\nCurrently, host specific functions have not been implemented in WasmEdge, for the windows platform. These functions are supposed to be implemented using the Win32 API and have to go rigorous testing before being deployed.",

          "description": "Running Kubernetes should be done with the utmost security in mind. KubeArmor provides a policy based system to increase the quality of security in a Kubernetes cluster. Users need to define their own policy when implementing KubeArmor. Most users might find it challenging to define the most appropriate and effective security policy based on their use case. Currently there are limited ways for users to actually get observability data that can be used to assist them and provide better reasoning when creating an optimal security policy. The solution to this problem is by providing visibility telemetry events to show pod or container observability data. Observability data can consist of processes executions, file system accesses, and network accesses. This information is expected to assist users to create an optimal security policy. This solution is implemented by developing and deploying a Kubernetes service that will connect to the KubeArmor relay and get the events from the daemonsets. These events will then be aggregated and stored in the database for future use. Users can get the data by using the KubeArmor CLI program which will be extended to accommodate this solution.",

Adapt the old reference system to the new one.\r\n\r\n2. Clean the current bibliography data, and identify the different types of entities that may be extracted.\r\n\r\n3. Generalize the entity reference system from bibliography: given a citation entry, the user should be able to navigate to the various types of entities using the links in the citation entry. This would conform to cakePHP conventions so that connections are bidirectional: in the entity page, the user should also be able to view which citation entries refer to this single entity.\r\n\r\n4.

Question Answering (QA) systems have worked very well to solve this problem. The Neural QA model focus on seq2seq learning to translate natural language questions to their respective SPARQL queries.

Although text as an input is an efficient approach to query the graph, there are cases where we do not know what we are seeing. How does one  search the knowledge graph (KG) in such cases?

Doing this will enable us to query the existing knowledge graphs using multiple modalities: images and text. To this end, in this proposal, we examine and explore two aspects of DB-KG:\n(a) A framework to create an image-based KG out of existing DBpedia entries;\n(b) Using the graph created to perform tasks like image querying, text + image search, and using relevant input images to add more images to existing articles.",

Niffler acquires images from the PACS in real-time (meta-extraction) and on-demand (cold-extraction), then extracts DICOM metadata into a Mongo database or a CSV file, and performs computations on the metadata to compute utilization metrics for the scanners. This project performs the computations for the MR scanners, although it can be used for any modality. However, these computations were largely limited to the study level - how frequently a scanner idled between studies and how long it took for a scanner to perform a given study. Computing those metrics in a finger granularity, at the series level, is more challenging since the start time and end time of a series is harder to find with just public DICOM headers.\nFurthermore, while this project has a scanner utilization computed in the backend, there is no integrated front-end to present the results elegantly.

          "description": "I would like to be a part of drupal.org in GSOC. The project Decoupled menus for Drupal. Which is the concept of making Drupal combined with New technology react. The two use cases which were used in the description were much interested. I was learning with the react over the past 10 months. So I would like to solve the problem in a good manner like combining the react with PHP or Python.  So, First of all, they asked us to build a menu section that should be globally active around the other pages. This can be done by the react components. Which I had the idea of doing it. In the second use case, they asked to create a menu(s) that changes from page to page like the \"Content Moderator Shortcuts\" menu to the \"moderator\" role. Which we can implement with React router dom. But the main task of this objective is to combine the react with drupal. While we know Drupal still serves as a backend repository, front-end frameworks can talk to the database via API calls. By making the  Make a stand-alone front-end and using drupal to create APIs which interact with the database. Then consume the API through HTTP AJAX or whatever mechanism React Js contains. Yeah, while coming to symphony it's been a task for me to learn it for using it as a framework. I have already had a little experience with the laravel framework.

          "description": "The write operation in flash can only change bits in a specific way and the erase operation changes all the bits of a block to 1s. So to modify any bit the whole block needs to be copied to another memory, erased on the flash, and then copied again from the other memory with the change. Due to this “erase overhead” write operations may require copying a lot of data to modify a small amount. Most flash chips support multiple erase-block sizes and flashrom keeps a list of these sizes and ranges for all supported flash chips. Currently, flashrom tries these functions one by one and uses the same function until the operation is completed or an error occurs. Usually, the first function works correctly but this function erases the smallest erase-block so flashrom would have to use it multiple times to complete the erase operation on a large region, which could have been done more efficiently using functions using larger erase-blocks, thus resulting in a transaction overhead. If a large erase-block size to erase a small region is chosen it would result in a larger erase overhead. So the erase-block size should be picked according to the size of the region left to be erased. Also checking in advance to tell if the programmer supports the given erase function and then sorting the supported functions in order of the erase-block sizes can further help the function selection.",

There are two types of power analyses: static, which is more of an estimation that ignores circuit operations, and dynamic, which simulates the circuit behavior in conjunction with switching power. These tools are Verilog gate level-simulations and SPICE simulations, respectively, but the former can be inaccurate while the latter is computationally demanding. IRSIM, a tool intermediate between these two simulation tools, simulates the circuit as a network of transistor capable of turning ON and OFF, serving as a tradeoff between speed and accuracy in dynamic power analysis. The goal of this project is to develop and enhance a command-line interface compatible with up-to-date transistor components in the IRSIM library to ensure the analysis accounts for various power domains.",

This proves using FPGAs on AWS F1, virtually ineffective for students, enthusiasts and early researchers.

The addition of support for Memory Mapped Interfaces like AXI4, AXI4 Lite, Wishbone and custom interfaces similar to RoCC, Core-V eXtension interface etc., would enable a wider ecosystem of hardware accelerators to support 1st CLaaS integration without any RTL Level modifications. \n\nBesides these, supporting 1st CLaaS on Local FPGAs/Remote FPGAs contrary to AWS F1 would prove useful to enthusiasts, researchers, professors and students having FPGA on-premise or remotely accessible. 1st CLaaS for PYNQ leverages the PYNQ (Python Productivity for Zynq) Framework, which consists of a Jupyter Server running in a Linux Operating system on the ARM Processor in the Zynq SoC. Addressing the current limitations of 1st CLaaS, the proposed framework that not only brings 1st CLaaS to PYNQ FPGAs, but also vendor agnostically automates TL-Verilog/Verilog/SystemVerilog based Hardware accelerator design from RTL to bitstream and deployment eliminating the need to interact with a wide range of vendor specific tools.

          "description": "Wireless communication and in particular WiFi networks are becoming more and more important. Research already focuses on improving reliability, performance of such networks and also efficiency of the underlying hardware. One promising candidate for improvements is TX-Power Control (TPC). Adjusting the transmit power per packet basically promises improvements in overall throughput in wireless networks and/or the efficiency by improved resource allocation in wireless networks.\nDated back to 2007, Atheros IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n chipsets driven by ath5k and ath9k Linux drivers did first and Mediatek joined recently with hardware support for tx-power control. Those also allow access to set the tx-power per packet, but yet do not provide a driver interface for this. Unfortunately, also the mac80211 subsystem, which is responsible for WiFi communication in the Linux kernel, does not provide an appropriate API to support TPC and per-packet annotation of tx-power.\n\nThe goal of this project is to implement the missing three-tier software parts: (1) mac80211 structs to annotate tx-power levels per packet, (2) mac80211 structs to account tx-power status information once transmitted and (3) a transmit power control (TPC) API for TPC algorithms. This is achieved by developing and implementing the required structs in the mac80211 subsystem, modifying  Linux WiFi drivers to make use of this API, and testing and validating the implementation in several experiments.",

But it has a few limitations. \n\nFirst, in order to fetch data from different Elasticsearch indices or to fetch details of different documents, user has to make multiple API request calls. \n\nSecond, users have to write CURL queries to work with the API which users may find complicated.\n\n\nProposed solution:\n\nThe main aim of creating a new backend for the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes project (FAANG) is to make accessing and handling required data for users much easier than the current setup. In order to achieve this the following are the main tasks for the project:\n\nFirst, creating a Back End for Fetching Data (BE Read): To create a GraphQL Server which will make it easy to fetch the required data using advanced operations like join and aggregations by making a single API call to the Back End.\n\nSecond, creating a Front End for Fetching Data (FE Read): To create a UI for selecting which data is to be fetched.\n\nHence using a GraphQL Server, user only needs to make a single API call, and with a better UI, user wont have to worry about writing queries for fetching data.\n\n\nDeliverables : \n\n1. Basic Fetching of documents (single and multiple documents of an elasticsearch index)\n2. Implementing Dataloader in the GraphQL server for decreasing DB hits\n3. Implementing Filter and Join functionality between elasticsearch indices for fetching data from the GraphQL server\n4. Implementing Aggregation for data to be fetched from the GraphQL server\n5.

          "description": "A key challenge surrounding modern bioinformatics is to manage and store the growing amount of biological data with both space efficiency and scalability. Traditionally, biological data are often stored as human-readable flat files or as entries in a conventional relational database. However, a drawback of such approaches is that the space required to maintain these data is becoming increasingly unmanageable, significantly reducing the scalability. Additionally, along with the size of the database, the time to query the database also increases. As stated in the problem statement, on Ensembl, homology data are currently stored as tuples in a relational database, resulting in the whole database being large and hard to scale. A natural way to compactly store the data is to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of homology relationships. We propose multiple hierarchical data structures and formatting methods to improve the space efficiency of homology databases as well as important metrics to consider when designing such data structures and formats. We propose these potential approaches with the application in actual gene homology databases in mind. As part of the project, we will implement the representations using Python and/or C++ and evaluate them using proposed metrics.",

Also, due to the poor entity normalization approach, many extracted entities are being ignored in the final output stage of the pipeline. \n\nThis project proposal aims to increase the entity detection capabilities of this “Named Entity Recognition” (NER) system by firstly integrating additional RegEx/string matching rules in the current pipeline. Secondly, by combining other training datasets with the existing IDP4 dataset and then extending this combined training dataset using active learning to capture more data classes in natural language form.

Our main tasks consist of implementing a new class of convex bodies to represent the space of correlation matrices and geometric operations for performing two random walk sampling algorithms (the accelerated billiard walk and Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm) over those convex bodies. These tasks can be supported by the already existing geometric facilities of VolEsti and the theoretical results found in related works. We will focus mainly on building an optimized C++ code to achieve better scalability for those algorithms and carry out intensive experiment and benchmark with other competitors to justify our efficiency. \n\nThe expected duration of this project is 175 hours spread over 7 weeks of coding period (June 13 - July 29).

Point to point solution is given below - \n\n1. There are better and more modern techniques than EWAH for compressing. Roaring+run bitmap can be used as an alternative to EWAH. So that, we can optimize the performance of compressing/decompression. I will also write performance tests to verify that.\n\nOne possible approach  to problem no. 3, is to add a new mode that only adds new bitmaps for commits introduced between successive bitmap generations.\n\nTo solve problem no. 2, we can create a `table of contents for these bitmaps. Taylor (mentor) has already initiated some work on it. I will finish it.",

Such an objective seems useful for: \nDiscovering the optimal format for performance critical applications.\nEasy conversion from one tool to another, for bioinformatics researchers and hackers.\n\nWe will achieve that by using an Internal Representation of the different possible semantic data represented in each format, that will then allow translation from one format to another.

These clusters can be in different geographical locations and be managed by different institutions.

Another thing I’ll focus on is the ability to easily add more templates, which could possibly require various changes across the ecosystem. I will be working in close cooperation with the Nautilus developers, GNOME design team, and with various user studies in mind. \nMy main goals are following:\n1. Design and implement an empty state in the New Documents menu, that will offer the user the ability to add new templates, both pre-defined as well as custom.\n2.

Inventory/Evaluation Phase: Variations in individual elements and composite components from each website are recorded to ensure all alternates are captured.\n\n2. Iterative Design Phase: Mockups are created for each evaluated component considering all the possible variations encountered during evaluation. The mockups will be subsequently iterated upon after review and deliberation with the Design Team and other project stakeholders.\n\n3. Implementation and Testing Phase: The final approved mockup will be implemented in TailwindCSS. The element/component will be documented and tested. Once the implementation is approved and all tests pass the element/component will be incorporated into the framework.",

A GSoC project in 2016 added an initial implementation for DAE solvers, namely, Ode 15 {i,s}, that use a variable step, variable order method , and is based on Sundials, to the Octave repository.\n\tThe major requirement now is to improve this implementation by creating an interface to SUNDIALS IDA API, using Octave's own classes and solvers, so that even SUNDIALS is not compiled against KLU (the solver used for sparse computations by IDA), a safety net is created for the end user such that sparse computations are never disabled in the Ode15{i,s} solvers, instead of falling to computing using dense implementations as before. This has the added benefits of avoidance in creating copies of data to send to SUNDIALS interfaces, as well as use of Octave's vectorized operations, allowing the solvers to be further optimized.",

          "description": "The proposed GSoC project aims at integrating support for the Faust audio programming language into HISE, an extensive framework for the creation of sample-based virtual musical instruments.\nThere are multiple ways to accomplish the integration, ahead-of-time compilation and just-in-time compilation, each with their specific benefits and shortcomings.\n\nThe most straight-forward method involves ahead-of-time compilation of the Faust code into a dynamic library which the HISE instrument can interface with.\nThis works well for finished products which will be exported and compiled once, but run many times.\nDuring prototyping, however, build time is essential and relinking the complete instrument would be excessive.\nIn that case machine code will be generated just-in-time (JIT) from the Faust source code whenever it is modified without recompiling or linking the rest of the instrument.\nFaust already provides the necessary mechanisms for just-in-time compilation via LLVM, which will be tied to suitable data structures inside HISE.\n\nLastly HISE also provides an integrated development environment (IDE) with a syntax-highlighting text editor to the instrument developer.\nProgramming the instruments in Faust should be an on-par experience to the developer when comparing to other supported languages, e.g., SNEX and JavaScript.\nTherefore the existing development environment will be extended to support the Faust language, while allowing the developer to still use their editors and tools outside of HISE.",

          "description": "For GHC 9.2.x to achieve more widespread adoption, tooling will need to support its best features. For years users have been frustrated by Haskell's conspicuous lack of support for namespacing features common in other languages. Haskell provides a limited form of namespacing with qualified imports, but using it to namespace field selectors tends to require hacky file structures. Fortunately, Haskell now provides `DuplicateRecordFields`, and GHC 9.2 introduced the `OverloadedRecordDot` language extension. These together provide a cleaner and more ergonomic interface for working with record types, a step towards better namespace support in Haskell.\n\nHLS already supports record dot-syntax to a small extent. For example, in the line `y = x.a`, type information is available when hovering over `y` or `x`. To unlock the full potential of this syntax though, HLS users should be able to \"dot into\" the record to see its fields, enabling IDE-driven API exploration. Additionally, type information for the `.a` part should be available to the user on hover. These are the main features I propose to add to HLS for this project.",

          "description": "The architecture of the GHC compiler in its current state is anti-modular. Designed with GHC-the-program as the sole consumer in mind, it is very difficult for newer tooling to reuse its components. These problems extend to the inclusion of new backends such that implementations for various target platforms forked GHC frequently.\n\nThe first step to improving the current design is the isolation of the different components and separation the codebase in layers for different purposes, described in the classic book \"Domain Driven Design\". This is already partly done, and in this project I join the existing effort by working on the next remaining subsystem: GHC's Core pipeline.\n\nIn order to achieve my goal, I will proceed by using an incremental bottom-up approach: Starting at the bottom of the module hierarchy, I will push references to upper layers module-by-module up in the callstack until they are completely removed from each component. For the entry points of each in-scope component, I will then provide component-specific configuration types and corresponding initialization functions. The in-scope components are specific configurable tasks of the optimizer, and the optimizer as a whole.\n\nWith this work completed, there will be significantly less references to the ubiquitous global states used throughout the whole compiler, namely the DynFlags and the HscEnv type, and significantly fewer imports of modules from upper layers, e.g. the driver.",

It would be beneficial to generalize GHC's runtime, make it separable from GHCSM, and connect it with a suite of different garbage collections from MMTk.\n\n\nTo achieve this goal, we propose to:\n1. Refactor GHC's runtime system to more effectively abstract over storage management operations;\n2. Introduce a storage management backend using MMTk's trivial no-GC collection plan;\n3. Integrate write barriers necessary for generational collection with MMTk;\n4. Introduce support for MMTk's semi-space and mark-sweep GC plans.",

          "description": "Conducting Cognitive Neuroscience Experiments has always been limited to research-grade EEG devices that cost tens of thousands of dollars. Since the conception of cheaper alternatives like MUSE, OpenBCI, etc - there have been an influx of consumer grade EEGs that allow the general public to have access to such devices. \nHowever, there is a lack of a standard and easy to use library to conduct and reproduce research on these devices. EEG - Notebooks provides the necessary software required to pull together the various enabling technologies necessary for running these experiments and analyzing the data. This can open dramatic new possibilities for both neurotech and cognitive neuroscience education, as well as more ambitious and large-scale research and clinical applications using large numbers of devices and or more naturalistic (out-of lab) settings. This leads towards the larger goal of contributing to the democratization of the cognitive neuroscience experimental world. \nIn its current state, the source code for the EEG-Notebooks experiment library is limited by its overly repeated and non-generalized code. This project seeks to tackle that issue by using classes and Inheritance to make the code easier to read, more extendable to the open source community, and a better experience for the general user.

          "description": "Artifacts are parts of a measured signal generated from sources other than those of interest. For electroencephalography (EEG) data, artifacts from a variety of physiological and environmental sources must be excluded or repaired to ensure that appropriate interpretations are applied during clinical evaluation and downstream analyses. We will develop a suite of web-based tools for facilitating artifact annotations for the Global EEG Norms project of the Global Brain Consortium (GBC). This project will enable clinical neurophysiologists to upload EEG data in standardized formats; annotate data with artifacts, such as electrical noise and movement artifacts, using a novel ontology that is interoperable with the Hierarchical Event Descriptors specification; and export this data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard. While the resulting libraries of this project will be integrated into a Progressive Web Application for clinical neurophysiologists, they will also be released standalone as tools to further facilitate the development of neuroscience tools on the Open Web. This could reduce the barriers to entry for neurophysiology research by enabling standalone data management and analysis applications to be released on modern browsers. In the long run, this may enable the rapid diagnosis of neurological disorders in lower to middle-income countries with unreliable internet connections.",

With this optimization, simulation runtimes and GPU memory usage could be reduced, achieving a higher precision in DW-MRI simulations, which could bring us closer to the real and complex behavior of the system that shapes brain tissue.\nDisimpy is a GPU-accelerated diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance simulator that is used for developing and validating neuroimaging methods.\nDiffusion MRI is an imaging modality that provides us with information such as the orientation, the size, or the shape of neurons from the random displacements of water molecules in brain tissue. Water molecule diffusion patterns show how the molecules interact with the environment, revealing microscopic details about tissue structure, either sane or impaired.\nDiffusion MRI simulations require high precision to represent reality meticulously. Hence, optimizing the code that runs the simulation seems reasonable and extremely important. This study sheds light on this issue by proposing examples on how to improve the code, such as an optimization of Subvoxel-Triangle intersection algorithm, Ray-Triangle intersection algorithm, and the way of saving triangles and an implementation of a new feature that could allow the simulation of more complex systems.",

The brain imaging data structure format is a widely-adopted framework for disseminating clean datasets for use in the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analyses (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This project would aid in this pursuit by establishing built-in support for the BIDS format within the Pydra software package. Pydra is a library that allows complete control of the command line through Python (e.g., within a Jupyter Notebook). The majority of brain imaging data is analyzed using many commands that operate in a serial manner for cleaning, aligning, and applying statistical models to the data often in batches. Rather than relying on shell scripting and manual documentation of software versions, commands used, and outputs that are generated, Pydra can do so automatically. Pydra not only allows commands to be run through Python that would normally be run within the command line, but also unlocks the ability to interface with any CLI binaries a user might have installed as third party tools. Beyond this, Pydra allows the development of ‘workflows’ or stepwise processing pipelines with traceable software and command provenance, allowing an individual to essentially run an exact analysis in a “frozen” environment that the original publisher/researcher/scientist used themselves.",

          "description": "Biologically detailed models are useful tools in neuroscience, and automated methods are now routinely applied to construct and validate such models based on the relevant experimental data. The open-source parameter fitting software Neuroptimus (formerly Optimizer) was developed to enable the straightforward application of advanced parameter optimization methods (such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms including PCs and supercomputers. Neuroptimus currently uses various built-in cost functions and those implemented by the eFEL feature extraction library to compare the behavior of the models to the (experimental) target data. However, this approach severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by the optimization. On the other hand, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors.\n\nThe aim of the current project is to extend the open-source neural parameter optimization tool Neuroptimus so that it is able to use test scores from the SciUnit framework as the cost function during optimization. Direct applications would include the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons using a combination of Neuroptimus and HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Implement changes in the Neuroptimus core so that it is able to use SciUnit test scores as cost functions during optimization\n2. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that arbitrary combinations of built-in cost functions, eFEL features, and SciUnit test scores can be used\n3. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that the new features become accessible from the graphical user interface\n4. Thoroughly test the newly implemented features and their integration with existing features of Neuroptimus",

          "description": "Event-based vision is a subfield of computer vision that deals with data from event-based cameras. Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are bio-inspired imaging sensors that work differently to traditional cameras in that they measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of capturing images at a fixed rate. Since the way event cameras capture data is fundamentally different to traditional cameras, novel methods are required to process the output of these sensors. In addition to dealing with ways for capturing data with event cameras, event-based vision encompasses techniques to process the captured data - events - as well, including learning-based techniques and models, spiking neural networks (SNNs) being an example.\n\nThis project aims to create benchmark datasets for object recognition tasks with event-based cameras. Using machine learning solutions for such tasks requires a sufficiently large and varied collection of data. The primary goal of this project is to develop Python utilities for augmenting event camera recordings of objects captured in an academic setting in various ways to create benchmark datasets. A secondary goal of this project is to test the performance of spiking neural networks for object recognition on the created datasets.",

At the moment, final paper submissions to NBDT are in LaTeX format. While there are tools that provide LaTeX to XML conversion (as required by PMC), no single tool does it seamlessly without errors for the template corresponding to NBDT. The current project aims to build an application providing this functionality. The project will build over the LaTeXML tool to enhance custom bindings as required for NBDT submissions. The first step would be to enhance the bindings for body matter, as Scholastica (which hosts NBDT) already provides it for front-matter binding. In addition, to make the application platform-independent, it will be extended to provide custom front-matter and back-matter bindings. It shall also contribute verification engines to automate XML verification, JATS verification, and PMC-specific verification.

This game is hugely inspired form a very popular game Wizard of Legend. The gameplay will be very similar to Wizard of Legend with joystick inputs, high-paced action and magical stuff.\nDevoir of Warrior is the story of a brave warrior on a journey to find and eliminate an unknown evil behind the lost rains. Along this journey, the player will have to explore the dungeons, solve the puzzles and defeat the enemies and Bosses. In the end, our warrior will eliminate the evil and bring back the rains to his homeland.",

          "description": "The audience of IHR largely consists of researchers, network operators, policymakers, and educators. The goal of the proposal is to make the IHR’s internet application an end-to-end solution for stakeholders to work on. Currently, the IHR website provides plots of internet latency and routing for AS and countries. The goal of this software subsystem is to add new plots showing speed test data collected by Measurement-Lab so that users can monitor how disconnections and routing events impact throughput. While providing the users with a quick lookup for the NDT test it becomes immensely important to co-relate IHR traffic analysis with Google and Cloudflare reports. Collecting data from similar services would also pump IHR’s anomaly detector to complement IHR’s alerting system. With IHR the hub for multiple network reports and metrics, it is vital to have a dashboard to customize visual data. I propose to develop a customized IHR dashboard that is self-exploratory. The dashboard would let end users explore the IHR dataset and monitor any event with respect to time and legends according to their purpose. The dashboard would let the user select a set source and destination networks, time periods, and a metric and correspondingly plot the data. Ultimately, adding an assistant to select a set of important networks from a selected country or global statistics about the plotted data.",

There exist various types of Internet data, mainly, tabular data (e.g., ASN or latency value), timeseries (e.g., AS hegemony per day), graphs (e.g., routing graph), paths (e.g., traceroutes, BGP paths). We will create at least one building block that can visualize each type of data. Different types of data need different types of visualizations.

          "description": "The erddapy package provides a Python interface to the ERDDAP data server API. Currently, most of erddapy's functionality is concentrated into a single class, and the URL building features are implemented in that class along with the data transformation methods that process server responses into Python objects, such as Pandas DataFrames.\n\nThis project proposes to separate erddapy into core and object (or opinionated) layers. The former will hold the URL building and data transformation functionality, which will be reused by the rest of the library. The latter layer will provide high-level objects that will support a functional API that does not depend on the state of the underlying object (which is the case for the current version of erddapy). This functional API will provide cleaner iterative usage when querying multiple servers and datasets, and new classes implemented in the object layer will support serialization so that they can be pickled and passed on to other processes or machines.\n\nTo execute this project, I delineate two separate aims: refactoring the URL building and data transformation functionality into a new module containing minimal, standalone functions and reusing those functions in the existing primary class; and implementing an additional layer containing the high-level objects that will provide the basis for the functional API. Overall, this will greatly improve the flexibility and scalability of the package, and will help support its wide spectrum of users.",

          "description": "Description:Kruize Autotune is a Performance Tuning Tool for Kubernetes. . It uses Hyper Parameter Optimization to tune the language runtime layers of a given application.\nSystem component metrics can give a better look into what is happening inside them. Metrics are particularly useful for building dashboards and alerts.\nKubernetes components emit metrics in Prometheus format. This format is structured plain text, designed so that people and machines can both read it.Following are four common methods of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning in order of increasing efficiency:\n1.Manual\n2.Grid search\n3.Random search\n4.Bayesian model-based optimization\n\nThe aim of Bayesian reasoning is to become “less wrong” with more data which these approaches do by continually updating the surrogate probability model after each evaluation of the objective function.\nAt a high-level, Bayesian optimization methods are efficient because they choose the next hyperparameters in an informed manner. The basic idea is: spend a little more time selecting the next hyperparameters in order to make fewer calls to the objective function. In practice, the time spent selecting the next hyperparameters is inconsequential compared to the time spent in the objective function. By evaluating hyperparameters that appear more promising from past results, Bayesian methods can find better model settings than random search in fewer iterations.So,this project aims at tuning kubernetes applications using bayesian optimization.",

          "description": "EAT (Eap Additional Testsuite) is a testsuite to develop tests against infinite number of JBoss servers. It’s an innovative tool because it’s creating the test once and testing with any version of the tested software. EAT is available for a number of server configurations and a CI pipeline can be built using the maven tool. The goal of the present project is to extend EAT with new features and tools. The implementation of the project is estimated to last from June to November (Large Size Project) and the timeline is envisaged as follows: During the 1st Phase (June 2022 - July 2022) a snapshot will be added for testing the latest version of JBoss Community Server. The newly added snapshot will be made available for use with the CI builds. Moreover, the extension of EAT with additional multiversion android projects (described at the second phase) will begin. Continuing to the 2nd Phase (July 2022 - September 2022), new multiversion Android projects will be added to EAT. In EAT there is already a basic android  multiversion example. This will be extended with other open source android projects demonstrating how EAT can be used to support multiversion real life android projects. Finally, during the 3rd Phase ( September 2022 – November 2022) a multi-version Android application will be developed and added to EAT. This app will enable users to upload  and view descriptions and ways of usage for various programs or functions.  The users will be able to upload the descriptions of projects related to EAT, how they can be used and other project related information. The documents will be proposed for acceptance and when accepted they will be stored in  e.g. google drive, from where they will be accessible for anyone interested.",

While the CLI is very powerful and user friendly, it should be used by power users (release team who installs and manages jenkins x clusters). We should not expect developers who are concerned with only the pipelines to install the cli (This does not scale when you have 100+ developers in the company) We do have a UI/dashboard, but it is read only, so users cannot use it to trigger release pipelines or stop running pipelines. In addition, we do not have an audit trail of who did what. So, we propose a new UI/dashboard which has feature parity with the CLI (including SSO and RBAC) The UI should make the JX cli redundant, and add more value to the user with easily available status and logs of the entire cluster",

To deliver better search results, web crawlers need to have a context of the data and to understand the data better, structured data is used. Structured data is the data which conforms to a data model, has a well defined structure, follows a consistent order and can be easily accessed and used by a person or a computer program. It is used by search engines to generate rich snippets, which are small pieces of information that will then appear in search results making the search results more relevant.\nCurrently Joomla! has rich snippets implemented but it uses inline microdata to implement rich snippets which is difficult to modify from the backend as it is hard coded into the html. With this project I’ll be working on to making it easier for the user to dynamically integrate structured data from the backend. \nFor the dynamic integration of structured data I’ll be using schema.org which provides a universally recognized format for structuring data on the Web. There are different ways to implement schema markup but for this project I’ll be using JSON-LD as it can be inserted into the web page without disrupting other contents or HTML and it is easy to store in the database. This project will help user to add, update or delete schema markup on the articles from the backend. It will give user an option to select the type of schema from the available schema types and then insert values for the attributes of schema properties in the form. Some useful data which is already present in other forms will be fetched using AJAX Interface and it will be directly inserted into the JSON object. After saving the article, the generated schema will be pushed into the head element of the page.",

It would be easy for the user if he/she can get that on the same page without any redirection and in the form of some iframes.\nIt could be better if this would be a complete tour of the click-through path as that will increase the convenience for users in a much more professional and better way and even to make this feature more user friendly, a user can create custom tours as per the requirement.\nAlso, this will allow third-party developers to ship their own tours with their extensions which will make it easier for the users, who will use the extension to be familiar with the same.",

          "description": "The main idea of IQS in digiKam is to determine the quality of an image and convert it into a score. This score is based on four criteria which are factors sabotaging image: blur, noise, exposure, and compression. The current approach is useful to determine images distorted by one of these reasons. However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require the setting for the hyperparameters. Hence,  we can reduce most of the fine-tuning parts to make this feature easier to use",

          "description": "PROBLEM:\n\nFlatpaks and Snap applications run in isolation from rest of the system, therefore they do not have access to the system resources (such as directories, buses and devices) that other applications take for granted. They access these permissions through Portals (in Flatpak's case) and Interfaces (in Snap's case).\n\nDiscover is KDE's application for installing software. Presently, Discover can show what permissions are necessary by Snaps and Flatpaks, but lacks a mechanism to change Flatpak's permissions. Flatpaks can access buses, but it is unclear what these buses do, to users. Snaps do offer a mechanism for changing these permissions within Discover's interface (through a popup), but this has 2 problems: first, the permissions will not be understandable to most users; second, the method of displaying these permissions is inconsistent with how it is done for Flatpaks.\n\nThe project's goal is to implement a mechanism to alter these permissions and their extents in a system settings module for each application, and show Snap permissions in a more informative, easier-to-digest way on Discover's interface, like for Flatpaks.\n\nPLAN TO IMPLEMENT:\nThe project is broken into 2 stages: the first is implementation of the feature that allows tweaking of Flatpak's application. This should be done by the end of Week 7. The second is the feature to display Snaps permissions more informatively on Discover's interface, like it is done for Flatpaks. This stage will take up the remainder of the weeks. \n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. mechanism to alter Flatpak permissions through a System Settings module for each application\n2. mechanism to alter Snaps' permissions through a System Settings module, for each application\n3. displaying Snap permissions with additional information such as brief descriptions and icons in their application pages\n4. implementation of an \"internal dictionary\" to explain what access level to each bus on the system implies to the user",

And for the Android implementation, I will be using Java and Android-specific XML.\n\nFirstly, in the main desktop client- the features of blockers would be included in the settings menu along with a simple feature switch. Pre-configured blocking lists would be shipped with each release. This would help us in filtering out the DNS requests and blocking the IPs in our target blocking list.\nI will package the entire solution in a self-contained Go Library that will be able to read packages from a given file descriptor and work accordingly.\n\nFuture Scope includes implementation in iOS environment and  implementing update mechanism.",

Delayed reflection of the\nmodified state of a channel to a collaborative user may cause inconvenience and may even lead to repetitive change to the same entity.\n\nThe current setup for Real-Time Communication in Studio involves maintaining a\nserver-side log which is being simulated by calling the POST method of sync API. All\ncollaborative users are hitting this POST method at regular intervals to post any changes made by them (if no changes are made then the empty changes array is posted) and receive any changes made by other users as a response of this method.\n\nThe proposed WebSocket architecture will neutralize and reduce the load on the server which is currently being created due to continuous polling of the APIs. It will convert the complex underlying structure of Sync API into a simple real-time-friendly architecture in which a full-duplex communication between client and server takes place. It will also enormously enhance the user experience of the whole process of collaborative content curation.",

          "description": "Premature birth is highly prevalent with every one in ten births being premature. A common complication in premature birth is hypothermia (the baby cannot regulate its body temperature). Low-middle income settings limit access to neonatal incubators and radiant warmers. Thus, there arises a need to develop low-cost solutions to support premature newborns in their early and vulnerable stages of life. KMC (Kangaroo Mother Care) is a technique widely practiced to provide thermal support to newborns. During KMC, a caregiver maximizes contact with the newborn by laying the newborn, skin-to-skin on their chest. Since KMC is a highly burdening activity, the caregiver might need breaks for personal care making the baby vulnerable to a loss of a thermal source. The patented NeoWarm device is a low-cost solution to this problem. It not only augments the natural KMC session by providing extra heat but also regulates and monitors the temperature of a newborn even when the caregiver-newborn dyad is not engaged in KMC (standalone mode). The NeoRoo app provides a digital interface to the NeoWarm device by monitoring the vitals of the baby over BLE and sending alerts to responsible medical professionals and parents if the baby's vitals are found to be abnormal. It also establishes a mode of communication between the medical professionals and the guardians of the baby so that there are shared goals, coordinated tasks along with exchange of information for better neonatal care.",

The goal of this project is to extend support for Z compressed graphic formats, namely .wmz and .emz, which currently can't be opened by LibreOffice.\n\nThe second goal of this project is to implement saving functionality for .svgz, .wmz and .emz. While .svgz is an option in the save dialog, it is incorrectly implemented (no compression actually happens, it's just an svg with a different extension).\n\nThe plan is to create a new and extensible way that uncompresses the file buffer after determining if its compressed from its header,and try to open the uncompressed file buffer.\n\nThe plan for the second goal would be to find a way to determine whether the file we're saving needs to be compressed (either by checking the extension or by creating a new option in the file saving dialog) and compress the file buffer before saving. This is not as easy as it sounds, as we need to factor in various pitfalls such as what happens when there's not enough RAM to hold the temporary compressed buffer for example.\n\nDeliverables would be an extensible way to load and save Z compressed files, an exhaustive unit test suite, which will test file detection, graphic loading, pitfall handling behavior and ready made test files.",

In Liquid Galaxy, a few games were developed that are supported by the cluster system, such as the Galaxy Pong, Galaxy Snake and more, in which lots of them were based on old famous games.\nOne of the first major hits of arcade games was Asteroids, released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field and the objective of the game is to increase the score by shooting and destroying the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' shot. The game gets harder as new asteroids spawn.\n\nFollowing this logic, the project's idea is to remake the original Asteroids game, with a modern design and new features, such as the multiplayer mode. It would be really nostalgic and fun to be able to play it again, especially for those who played it back in the 80's and 90's. Moreover, due to its complexity, uniqueness and system support, the project may be a part of the Liquid Galaxy demonstration, bringing more emphasis to the lab.",

It uses master-slave architecture and multiple displays to create an immersive environment. This project is based on an android app where users can plan the reforesting missions, by defining areas of seeding, specific seed/tree location, drone landing points, fly zones, and other helpful metrics. All the gathered information is dynamically displayed on the Liquid Galaxy cluster using KMLs and also on the app with the help of graphics and text to bring users a great and immersive overview of the mission panorama. This project will help in developing the next generation of this android app which includes advanced features like Flight Plan Tools and Drone Visualization. We'll also be adding the ability to import data from external storage services and the ability for the app to work with different languages. We'll be building the new UI for the seamless integration of these features and by the end of the GSOC period, we'll be delivering an android app that has all these new abilities listed above.",

We segregate the KML data into the various tracks to get a more neat visualisation of the different Map data, such as Lava flow, Historic flow, Earthquake Magnitude, Detected events, Located events, Affected areas, etc. Then we write the code to send KML data from our Flutter app to the Liquid Galaxy to visualise this data on the Liquid Galaxy rig. We store all the web scraped data in the assets so web scraping is no longer needed once data of all tracks is gathered.

          "description": "One of the challenges in High-Energy Physics(HEP) is fast simulation of particle transport, and hence various deep neural network methods have been studied for reducing the time-consumption. The Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) have achieved similar performance as the full Monte Carlo based simulation, but with reduced time taken. As quantum computers promise many advantages over classical computing, comes a question on whether quantum machine learning (QML) can give any improvement in solving the problem. This project aims to demonstrate quantum machine learning's potential, specifically Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN), in HEP events data generation and classification from image data. Although many previous works have tried to classify images with QGAN, none of them is fully quantum. This project will be aimed at producing new 'accurate' data with a fully quantum implementation of QGAN, along with integrating it with the Physics channel of the LHC e.g. the Higgs-Boson production event.",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have previously been used to successfully distinguish between distinct types of substructures such as no substructure, vortex substructure, and spherical substructure. In this task, we'll classify images based on whether or not they have a strong lensing effect. Strong Gravitational Lensing allows us to analyse the substructure of dark matter, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of its underlying nature. The observed strong lens images may be utilized in the Deeplense pipeline for dark matter substructure classification, anomaly detection, and interpretation. Images may be processed using a variety of algorithms. We'll try out several types of models, fine-tune them to obtain good outcomes, and compare them. Because a single model may not be sufficient, we can combine the findings of several models using ensembling to obtain a more robust and better outcome. We'll document and record every outcome as we experiment with our models.

Strong gravitational lensing has proven to be an effective method for detecting the substructures of dark matter halos.

Recently, Deep Learning techniques have been quite successful in classifying different substructures and predicting the mass densities using images from the simulation of strong gravitational lensing. DeepLense is one of the projects that uses state-of-the-art Deep Learning methods to exploit this information from the underlying substructures. \n\nThis project will, thus, focus on the further development of the DeepLense pipeline to integrate Vision Transformers as another approach to the existing implementations of ResNets and Equivariant Networks.

Implement any other methods that behave\ndifferently from the default.\n\n3. funcexp.{h,cpp}: in FuncExp::FuncExp(), add a new entry fFuncMap[\"json_valid\"] = new Func_json_valid().\n\n4. CMakeLists.txt: Add any source files to build.\n\n● Borrow and translate:\n1. JSON_* functions are already implemented in MariaDB leveraging its own JSON format parser\n\n2. The parser itself is couple files only library. Here is the main file.\n\n3.

I will achieve this by creating a Python library that exposes methods to create, update and search on encrypted indices stored in content repositories in a Matrix homeserver.\n \nAs a part of the project I will be demonstratively integrating the library into an existing Matrix client.

This is so common a task that even small inefficiencies add up. This project aims to make this task more convenient by integrating energy readers for output files of a number of MD engines into the auxiliary data framework of MDAnalysis. An in-depth tutorial of how future auxiliary data readers can be written, based on the lessons learned in this project, will also be provided to assist further development of this system of MDAnalysis.",

The challenge is that not every piece of data exists explicitly in the file, which brings an extra task on MDAnalysis to guess those data. This mission of guessing have the main problem of dealing with different formats that don’t speak the same language, and its representation of the same data may happen in a completely different way. That’s why we need a guesser class that is aware of the language of the universe of which it is a part.\nProject idea\nThe project has three main deliverables:\n•\tadd a convenient way to provide the guessing context to the universe.\n•\tbuild a robust guesser for the PDB file format.\n•\tbuild a robust guesser for the Martini force field.",

Adding timezone preference for users and adding the time zone field in submitted listens will contribute to the analysis and thus provide better user experience.

The main work involves making an appropriate table in Postgres to store timezones, designing a react UI page and implementing the corresponding API endpoints.

          "description": "This project is to enable the selection of multiple blocks at the same time and allow moving and doing actions on multiple blocks on Blockly. This behaviour is pretty much the same as when you try to manage your files on your Operating System, and you can drag a rectangle to select multiple files, then moving them around, copying, deleting.\n\nThe design is that the Blocks multi-select feature will be only functional when you hold the Shift key, so that users can still drag the workspace when not. Users can simply click on the blocks to select or unselect them, or drag a rectangle to select a set of them at the same time. A button would also be added to enable multi-selection feature in case users are unable to access the keyboard.\n\nIt sounds like a little bit easy, but actually, I would say that it's not. Multiple selections can become a crazy-complex feature when you start thinking about the details. When dragging two blocks, you have to think about how the connections will work. When you right-click on multiple selections, you also have to make sure that those options apply to all blocks. And the touch screen problem would also need to be addressed.\n\nThe feature request (https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/issues/267) has remained open on the GitHub Issues for 6 years, but it's still in the discussion phase and far from the beginning of Implementation there. So I hope we can implement that during GSoC 2022 if possible.",

          "description": "The project implements the Pitch Shift effect for the Mixxx DJ Software Application. The Pitch Shift effect raises or lowers the original pitch of an audio signal. Before the effect was implemented, the pitch could be changed only using the deck's rate slider separately. Unfortunately, the mentioned Pitch Shifter has no wide range and imposes significant restrictions on ways other effects can interact with the sound. In this project, the new Pitch Shift effect is introduced in the built-in effects, which can be used in the effect chain. It implements the wish \"Add a Transpose / Pitch Shift effect\" for the Mixxx software. Primarily, it allows a user to use a much wider range, than the Pitch Shifter for the deck player and, of course, other useful options like Formant Preservation or semitone chromatic scale mode. Due to the produced latency based on the pitch processing, the production delay has to be handled for the Dry/Wet and Dry+Wet modes to ensure that the original (dry) and processed (wet) signals overlap. The project is expanded by the implementation of the Group Delay handling for the effect chain.",

Conversion to SBML format from SBGN or SIF is lossy since the data models are not fully compatible. Information may be lost during conversion to SBML format. This is why supporting the SBML format in Newt is crucial.

It will also implement a quota system to prevent abuse of computing resources.\nThis will be accomplished by using a predefined SSH connection to the facility. Instead of user holding the private key and moving the public key to the remote submit node, the server holds a database of all remote nodes and for each node it creates a separate public and private key pair.  The public key will be copied to the remote node. The private key would be saved on the server. Whenever an authenticated user tries to connect to a particular submit node in the HPC facility, the private key for that node will be fetched by the server and will be used to authenticate the user against that remote node and there will be no need for the user to configure and enter any private key at all. Thus there will be just one private key for all users of a particular submit node. Server will also keep a tally of all the users that are currently using the server's private key at the moment. This will help implement a quota system to ensure that the resources are not maxed out.\nOver the span of 12 weeks, a customized version of cloud COPASI will be produced that will provide an easy to use interface for UConn users to submit their jobs and get results in quick time.",

          "description": "The study of urban morphology relies on clever abstractions of the built environment into computationally tractable models. One such model, the street network, is a graph whose edges are streets and nodes are street intersections. Network analysis tools are often tailored for street networks with the purpose of routing. In shortest path computations, network data must carefully reflect not only urban infrastructure but also the intricacy of transportation policies–such as multiple lanes and traffic direction. From the perspective of urban morphology, these features add noise to the geometric order of cities. Perpendicular two-lane streets cross in four intersections, producing a dummy city block, for example. Street networks carefully processed to answer pressing accessibility questions are not suitable for morphological analysis.\n\nWe would like to develop source-agnostic functions to process street network data for meaningful morphological analysis. The final network should be, at least, free from multiple nodes representing the same intersection and multiple edges representing the same street. This processing must rely on inherent network properties such as node connectivity and edge lengths, but not on auxiliary data such as OSM tags and building footprints. The functions will be collected under pysal’s momepy module, added to an existing toolbox of scalable urban morphological analysis.",

          "description": "The project aims to fill the current gap in the creation of a baseline urban grid that allows for network analysis of the morphology of street networks. The idea of the project is to develop a set of tools within the current momepy.preprocessing module that combined with the current integration of NetworkX can output a solid, consistent and repeatable analysis of the urban form. \nGiven that other libraries have also approached this issue (namely osmnx.simplification and citiyseer.tools.graphs), the idea is to contribute from the persisting issues of such libraries to then continue with a solution that is much more independent. Issues like multiple Points on LineStrings, snapping ends, and curving segments have already been addressed by such tools, but parallel LineStrings, and enclosed Linestrings (eg. round-abouts) still need to be resolved, to name a few. It seems that a categorization of the different topological issues (likely similar to the ones just mentioned) could create a framework from which to approach a final pipeline. However, it is proposed that early tests of different potential avenues be performed to sketch a planning route going forward (one of such tests is exemplified under the Approach section). The ideal solution is expected to be source-agnostic, but also leverage the current efforts already done by the community.\nOverall, the idea is to prioritize work alongside the mentors and the community to focus on increasing the short-term benefits of all PySAL/GeoPandas users (some of whom might already be familiar with some of the other corrections). As the project progresses over different iterative approaches, it is expected to incorporate more performance tests to counterbalance the feasibility of each approach as well as to build the desired autonomy of the tools to be reliant exclusively on input geometries.",

          "description": "Electromagnetic devices have become ubiquitous in our lives due to their limitless applications. For designing and optimizing such devices, non-uniform and unstructured meshes are essential, due to the multiscale nature of the problem. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is well known for handling such meshes. FEniCSx is an open-source platform for solving partial differential equations with the FEM, offering high-level Python and C++ interfaces. It has become a popular choice among FEM users, especially for solid mechanic and fluid dynamic applications. However, FEniCSx has not met the same popularity for electromagnetic applications due to the lack of comprehensive demos showing how to correctly setup and solve electromagnetic partial differential equations, and therefore many researchers and engineers in this field prefer to use other (often commercial) FEM platforms. This proposal aims to solve this issue by developing extensive and accessible electromagnetic demos for a number of case studies. In particular, the work will focus on delivering at least five demos (plus tests and documentation), regarding 1) the use of complex numbers, the implementation of 2) Scattering Boundary Conditions, 3) Perfectly Matched Layers, and 4) Maxwell's equations for axisymmetric structures, and 5) the parallelization of a parameterized problem with the MPI COMM_SELF communicator.  These additions will be a step towards the extensive use of FEniCSx in the electromagnetic community since they will provide working tools for real-world problems. The demos will also be a show-reel for new features of FEniCSx that have not been covered in past demos or tutorials. A long term effect of this work could be more developers involved in the FEniCSx project, more guiding feedback from end users, and promotion of open source software for electromagnetic/photonic simulations.",

          "description": "For simulating a system that contains many variables and/or equations, traditionally computational engineers tend to focus on utilizing an appropriate method with realistic time and space complexity. The technique of model order reduction (MOR), however, aims at approximating the original model with reduced number of variables and/or equations and still keeping sufficient accuracy. MOR is especially useful in various industries, for example thermal-fluids engineering, micro-electro-mechanical systems and control, where large-scale simulations have to be performed.\n\nThe methods of model order reduction can be classified into several classes including proper orthogonal decomposition, reduced basis, balanced truncation, etc. Several MOR libraries have been well developed in MATLAB and Python. For instance, pyMOR is a Python library that relies on the application of reduced basis methods to parameterized partial differential equations. MATLAB's model reducer supports pole-zero simplification, balanced truncation mode selection methods and so on.\n\nIn Julia, the main package that enables symbolic modeling is ModelingToolkit.jl, whose key features consist of automatic transformation and structural simplification, but it needs further works on fast ML approximate transformations. So this project is targeted on implementing MOR methods as extended features for ModelingToolkit.jl. Besides implementation of methods of model order reduction, the expected deliverables will include documentation which shows both the improved simulation time and accuracy penalty for the application of different MOR methods on test problems from various disciplines.",

The goal of the project is the full implementation of the VF2++ algorithm, which is an improved version of the original VF2 algorithm, extended to directed and multigraph settings, in a nonrecursive manner. \n\n\nThe brief description of the original algorithm (VF2) is that, after verifying  that both the input graphs have the same number of nodes and the exact same degree sequences, it starts constructing a mapping, between the nodes of the two graphs. If the mapping can be extended such that, every node from the first graph is matched to a node of the second graph, then the two graphs are considered to be Isomorphic.\n\nThe imporved version (VF2++), performs a preprocess, during which, a matching order is found, such that the algorithm is able to recognize the feasibility of the examined branches, avoiding a significant amount of computations by excluding the infeasible ones. \n\nThe plan to solve the problem is the following.\n\nStep 1: \nextensive research, questions asked and ideas discussed with the mentors. Establishment of a clear understanding of the topic is crucial.\n\nStep 2: \nDecomposition of the problem into smaller and more distinct, less complex sub-problems.

          "description": "Currently, exact inference for Gaussian processes within PyMC makes heavy use of Cholesky decompositions that have a cubic asymptotic time complexity. Fortunately, modern hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs) can improve the computational efficiency of large vector and matrix operations. While this hardware doesn't greatly benefit Cholesky decompositions, an approach called \"blackbox matrix multiplication\" (BBMM) has been developed for exact inference of Gaussian processes. BBMM efficiently utilise the benefits of GPUs, leading to quadratic asymptotic time complexity. This project aims to replace Cholesky decompositions required for inference of Gaussian processes with BBMM and similar methods, leading to massive improvements in computational efficiency for Gaussian process inference in PyMC.",

          "description": "Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs), a type of Bayesian nonparametric models, have recently gained strong attention from researchers, and become an active research topic in machine learning’s multi-task learning. The advantage of multi-output GPs is its capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have the same source of uncertainty from inputs. This provides a useful and practical approach for various applications in different fields. \n\nThe creation of new sampling methods and the advance in computing power have paved the way for the development of Bayesian models. Different software frameworks have been built to facilitate this probabilistic programming approach. Among those, PyMC is one of the most popular frameworks with a large and strong community. PyMC provides friendly interfaces that allow users in academics and industries to perform both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian data analysis. For Bayesian nonparametric models, the Gaussian process module in PyMC supports various mean and kernel classes. However, the current GP implementations in PyMC are limited to single output. This project aims to add support for multi-output GPs in PyMC. This feature would significantly extend the capabilities of this important module and benefit the PyMC community.",

DPs are daunting both theoretically and computationally as their non-trivial implementation would benefit from polished non-user facing methods in Aesara - formerly Theano - and AePPL. The former provides the computational backend to PyMC whereas AePPL converts arbitrary Aesara graphs into equivalent log-probability graphs which are convenient for automatic differentiation and hence sampling. The goals of my proposed Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project are threefold: relax the univariate assumption of components in mixture models, allow the creation of mixture graph via IfElse and Switch statements and continue ongoing efforts to add a DP functionality to PyMC.",

          "description": "Analyzing positional features/annotations in sequences is important in bioinformatics. Visualizing such data is quite a challenging task, considering the large amount of data to be displayed. The feature viewer is an open source javascript library developed to visualize biological data (referred to as features) mapped to a linear sequence (Paladin et al., 2020). For instance, it can be configured to visualize the location of protein domains or amino acid variations in a protein sequence. The feature viewer is being used in several popular bioinformatics resources such as neXtProt and COSMIC 3D.\n\nCurrently, the feature viewer supports limited configurability options in the features displayed, such as the color, shape and on-click behavior. This is too restrictive for some of the possible use cases of the feature viewer, where more flexibility is required in the display of features. One such instance is when different types of amino acid variants should be displayed in a color-specific manner in the same feature track.\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve the configurability of the feature viewer, such that it allows greater flexibility in the visualization of detailed biological data.",

Firstly, the aim is to extend the Procrustes library to include algorithms solving PSDP as a new class of Procrustes problems along with benchmarking the implementations. Secondly, the plan is to introduce additional extensions to the library involving solutions to the PSDP problem where the trace, diagonal elements, or other linear constraints over the transformation (i.e., the matrix) are imposed.",

Once the tool is equipped, RDKit users will have another way to construct a molecule.\n\nThe core work of the project will involve working on reimplementation of the Python programs function's. The main two steps of the program are 1) deriving atomic connectivities from coordinates and 2) determining the most favorable bond ordering from atomic connectivities. Atomic connectivities are found using either the Huckel method or through consideration of van der Waals radii. Favorable bond ordering is determined by considering different possible valences. The project is hence split up into these subparts. Bond ordering, atomic connectivity, formal charges, and the molecule’s conformation, among a few other factors, are combined to create an RDKit mol object.",

          "description": "The project I want to focus on is developing a more compact version of DIY robot for younger students,opposed to the more modular design it currently has . This robot will have a compact design with little or no expandability in order for the students to engage more in the robot’s programming and understand various concepts. For that reason, we will have to ensure the robot’s resilience to avoid accidents and make it durable.\nApart from that, I plan on developing use-case scenarios in greek, ready to use by the teachers, including course objectives and possible extensions for each one.It would be nice to also develop extensive and simple guidelines of how to print and assemble the robot for everyone to follow, despite their technological background.\n\nSince we want the students to focus on programming and learning to develop their own algorithms, it is important to develop an easy-to-use, kids-friendly environment, preferably a desktop app, integrating Google’s Blockly. During the last GSoC, an API system was developed, so that using Blockly is expected to be easy. So, I would love to connect both the compact version and the full one with Scratch/Blockly following ELLAK ‘s aesthetics, like this existing prototype. The app should be colourful and have an interactive design, specially designed for students, also having multiple pop ups and information about their actions and whether they were successful or not. I would like to turn programming into a fun activity, so that the children can learn while having fun.\nHowever, since Blockly’s integration requires modifying the core library, I plan on rewriting some parts of the Raspberry Pi’s code  concerning movement control. There will be a custom functionality library for special control of every electronic part and sensor.",

          "description": "The 2010s decade marked a beginning for widespread compiler testing with the release of programs like Csmith, a C program generator that since its release has found and reported over 400 compiler bugs. However, as highlighted by a recent study, the research on compiler testing has critically neglected the front-end component of compilers, leaving unfound bugs in the type checking procedure of compilers. More specifically, this could lead to the compilers of statically-typed languages, which utilize features such as type inference, both accepting erroneous programs and rejecting correct ones.\r\nHephaestus is a tool designed to test the compilers of three languages, namely Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It has already successfully detected over 150 bugs in the compilers of these languages. I propose a way to extend Hephaestus for it to be able to successfully test and detect bugs in the compiler of TypeScript. This can be a great contribution to the user-base and community of TypeScript, a language that has risen in popularity and usage in the past years.\r\nHephaestus detects bugs by:\r\n1.\tgenerating semantically-valid programs that (a) utilize parametric polymorphism and (b) are abstract\r\n2.\tgenerating these programs in an intermediate representation (IR), an OOP language that supports parametric polymorphism and type inference\r\n3.\tusing translators to convert the abstract IR program to the desired language.",

Currently, it has \"File ID\" or FID to \"entry\" or name lookup functionality, AKA, reverse lookup and also normal lookup, which is “name” for a given FID [afs_dir_Lookup and afs_dir_InverseLookup]. afs_dir_InverseLookup is currently computationally expensive because the algorithm scans a hash index data structure embedded within a \"Directory object\" [src/dir/dir.h] looking for a name that matches the given FID. It is not performant as it's merely brute-forcing the search.[src/dir/dir.c]\n\n[Solution]\nMaintain a separate hash table to store reverse lookup information with key: FID and value: name, the opposite of the existing hash table within in the Directory object. I would create this hash table within the Directory object again because it could avoid the penalty of maintaining a global data structure where all the information could be stored, and would also avoid the unnecessary loading of information of the entire volume, if only one file is looked up. Global table for all directories could also perhaps not scale to really large volumes. A \"lazy\" allocation of this table, that is, fill it in only when the first request is made per Directory Object for a \"reverse\" lookup would be efficient.\n\n[Deliverables]\n1. Code\n - Update the existing data structures [DirHeader], hereby referred to as DS.\n - Change the afs_dir_InverseLookup code to use the new DS\n - Lazy load* the information into the DS when the first request is made to “reverse” lookup.\n - Update the code* wherever directory updates are present (like adding and deleting a file inside the directory)\n * Ensure the synchronization primitives are correctly used\n \n2. Tests\n - Correctness tests: check if the written code is working as expected. Asserts can be added to ensure both the hash tables are coherent.\n - Performance tests: check the speed of execution of the current code vs the new code in the same environment (HW and OS)\n\n3.

One important aspect of time series analysis of astronomical sources is to identify and characterize their variability from their light curves. The light curves of these sources are affected by spurious variability from variable backgrounds and gaps due to occultation or inaccessibility of the source. This causes data to be affected by Poissonian uncertainties. In the case of sources that are near to detection limit of telescope, these uncertainties are dominant.\n\nBayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) is a statistical method to measure variability in Poisson-distributed data. The method has been developed to analyze X-Ray light curves of faint sources observed by eROSITA telescope.

This project seeks to implement a basic set of operations for X-Ray timing analysis in Julia. Although the Stingray python package already contains most of these tools, a Julian implementation has the potential to be faster and more flexible due to its multiple dispatch feature. \nI will start by creating a basic series of unit tests the code needs to pass, then implement core features from Stingray like LightCurves and EventLists, and move on to implementing power and cross spectra with different types of inputs. After implementing time lag and coherence, if the time permits, I will analyse and try to implement a basic variability vs energy spectra. Proper documentation and weekly blogs are other deliverables in this project.",

On the other hand, many projects today are done in Python, almost excuslively using Numpy for their numerical operations (like data arrays). \nPython and Numpy are actually written in C, therefore they have very well-defined interfaces for communicating with installed C libraries, using CPython. Since both Gnuastro and Numpy's core data structure are very similar, we plan on building a converter between the two. This will make it possible to perform all data operations using Numpys C-API. This will be followed by adding a low-level wrapper infra-structure which will allow easy usage of Gnuastro’s powerful libraries in Python.\nThus, the final goal is to have Gnuastro be an importable module in Python (just like Numpy) and have all the inner data operations of Gnuastro be performed using Numpy's C-API.",

          "description": "Deep learning is now used to solve many different CV problems. A typical approach is to train a separate network for each specific task. However, there is a need for models that are closer to the human brain and can solve multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a branch of machine learning, in which multiple tasks learn simultaneously through a shared model. It has the following advantages: improving data efficiency, reducing overfitting through shared representation, and using auxiliary information to learn quickly.\nThe project has four objectives:\n1. One or more multi-task CV models trained (or borrowed, if the license is appropriate), and submitted to OpenCV model zoo. Specifically, at least MCN or networks with similar functions should be successfully transplanted or improved for OpenCV, and the accuracy and less computation should be provided, which is not lower than that of the existing single OpenCV model.\n2. quantize the model on the condition that the accuracy does not decrease too much. At least try to quantize the model and make a trade-off between performance and effectiveness at the end.\n3. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided multi-task models. Ideally, there should be an API introduced to optionally disable some parts of the multi-task CV model and save time by not computing unnecessary parts/heads of the model.\n4.

          "description": "Valhalla is a routing engine built on OpenStreetMap data, that allows for high flexibility by providing diverse routing modes and routing filters. \n\nInitially, Valhalla received transit data from Transitland API, which converts GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data into a database. However, Transitland data is no longer compatible with Valhalla due to their internal updates. To bring back transit routing support to Valhalla and make it less reliant on third-party software, it can receive transit data from GTFS directly. \n\nThere are downsides of simply updating the code for Transitland: (a) it is dependent on OpenstreetMap, making Valhalla heavier, while GTFS can be independent, (b) Valhalla is still vulnerable to future changes in Transitland code that may break the code.  Therefore, this proposal is for an independent integration of transit data from RAW GTFS, rather than being dependent on a third-party platform.",

          "description": "Nominatim is OSM’s own geocoding software. When a user is searching for a specific place, Nominatim returns multiple results that are likely to be what the user is looking for. These search results are ranked based on their importance values that are being derived from looking at the popularity of the locations’ Wikipedia articles. However, not every place on Earth has its own Wikipedia article. As a result, each of the places that do not have their own Wikipedia articles does not have an assigned importance value to be used to rank them correctly among the other locations in the search result. OSM publishes aggregate map access numbers that are generated based on the users’ behavior when using the map. These access numbers are a good indicator of how popular a place is. The aim of this project is to integrate the map access numbers into Nominatim to compute an importance value for all places regardless of whether they have their own Wikipedia article or not. In order to fulfill the aim of this project, a set of deliverables needs to be defined and accomplished. These are:\n\n1) Finding the most suitable method of importing GeoTIFF files \n2) Developing the import functionality\n3) Investigating and developing the importance value computation algorithm based on the map access numbers\n4) Writing unit tests\n5) Documenting the new changes",

          "description": "We usually need visualization, in fact, to enhance the interpretability of data or results, and facilitate the understanding of developers and users. In machine learning, 3D or 4D representation provides more depth information than the 2D representation, many of the tasks may be much better understood if we provide a 3D or 4D. But OpenVINO has no native real-time 3D visualization engine or library. This can be very troublesome for users who use display 3D images. So our goal is working natural 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO (AI inference). There are a few solutions in Jupyter 3D graphic display, though:\n\n1. Requires complex setup, build or is not friendly to the average user (without graphics programming experience)\n2. Not integration with OpenVINO(Need process different data and different inference results available from OpenVINO, the user only needs a simple interface to set this up)\n\nThe project idea aims at fill in the gaps mentioned above:\n\n1. Provides a clean interface to set up the display of these graphics without the need for a graphical programming background(beginner-friendly)\n2. 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO(Be able to transform and process the output data of OpenVino)",

          "description": "Oppia frontend codebase is fully typed, but our typing doesn’t yet pass strict TypeScript checks. This means that variable assignment, procedure parameters, and function return values will all be clearly connected with a type. Strict is a typescript compiler option that enables a set of tougher type rules that, when enabled, assist lower the possibilities of producing surprising outcomes and make the code more resilient, but Oppia's code base presently fails to pass these stringent requirements. As a result, the code is vulnerable to unexpected actions and failures. To avoid this, modify the strict TypeScript config file such that all newly-added files must be strictly typed, and Introduce strict typing for about 280 twins of files, as well as tests for those files (for a total of 560 files), and ensure that no more unknown type is used, as well as removing all unknown type usage from the newly strictly typed files. The document also lays out the whole implementation approach for the idea, as well as the milestones I'll need to fulfil to finish this project.",

OWID uses a range of choropleth maps, but size-scaled maps have downsides, primarily because human visual perception associates areas with importance. Furthermore, readily available alternatives use mosaic cartograms, which distort the shape of countries.\n\nTo solve this problem, in a sentence, the primary objective is to plot a visually conclusive world map by illustrating territories/countries using a method for trading off shape and area.\n\nThe basic idea of the solution is to distort the size-scaled world map while preserving the shape of countries to generate a population-scaled world map. Furthermore, a manually generated population-scaled world map acts as the reference for optimizing the cost function for better results.\n\nFinally, an option to rearrange the cells in the grid to nitpick the details yields the final result of the cartogram.",

That’s how we can make multiple blocks after submitting the data. We will call the backend REST APIs in Django or flask, which will take those data blocks containing time intervals images and text.

          "description": "With the increase in use of technology and the internet, the risks associated with the internet are also increasing at a very high rate. Hence, it is necessary to have a system in place to protect our systems from such risks. The risk of malicious attacks is especially higher when browsing the internet. Thus, there is a need for an external system to intervene and block any unauthorized requests to the web server. A web application firewall(WAF) does just that. Modsecurity follows the OWASP Core Rule Set(CRS) rules to detect any vulnerabilities. This helps make web browsing more secure. The CRS has different Paranoia Levels which represent different security levels. At higher paranoia levels, the system has a stricter set of rules to block malicious activities. However, at such high paranoia levels, many genuine requests also get blocked as they resemble malicious activities. These are known as false positives. Such a large number of false positive detections hinders the user experience and as a result, they may stop using CRS and compromise security. Hence, it is important to reduce the number of false positive detections. As the data isn’t labeled, using an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm is the best possible way to achieve this. With the existing proposal by Floriane Gilliéron as a basis, I would work on an unsupervised learning algorithm for the machine learning plugin and aim to get it integrated as an official plugin. I will also add additional features to the plugin.",

          "description": "AF_XDP is an address family that is optimized for high performance packet processing. AF_XDP redirects raw network packets to user mode through the XDP program. AF_XDP, like DPDK, can be used to bypass the Linux kernel to gain high-performance processing network packets.  DNSDist acts as a load balancer and often needs to process and forward packets. Therefore, in order to forward DNS requests DNSDist needs the raw network packets processed by the Linux kernel network protocol stack, read its request, and send the same request to the downstream DNS server again through the Linux kernel network protocol stack. The repeated processing of the same or similar data by the Linux kernel network stack is an unnecessary overhead for the server deploying DNSDist. This overhead can be effectively avoided by bypassing the Linux kernel through AF_XDP.",

As well, the ability to participate in and browse the showcase should not be hindered by one’s physical abilities, thus increasing accessibility will further BOND the community, especially in the parts of the community that are not as well represented.\r\n\r\nThis project will deliver three stages of changes: the community approach, the support, and the narrative. The community approach will implement a hashtag and social media challenge to expand community discussion/bonding beyond the showcase launch date. The support phase will focus on tweaking specific functions to greatly improve UI and accessibility, as good design will open up the p5 community/showcase to underrepresented communities, such as the impaired. Lastly, the narrative phase will introduce the implementation of an \"Explore\" tab alongside of the current \"Gallery\" tab, which will encompass a digital gallery that allows viewers to freely explore the works and create their own narratives, adding more personality/personal voice to each submission.",

For documentation, it seems necessary to make certain additions to better orient developers who are new to 3D graphics and shaders, including graphics quirks that go beyond p5.js, such as the depth sorting challenges mentioned in issue #5420. I would also like to contribute documentation that helps users better understand the structure of WebGL in p5.js, information that is currently only available within the contributor documents.

This Fourier-transformed sensor data can be used to infer data within the brain in a very similar way as the time-series data but with an added, fifth dimension for frequency. MNE-Python has all the components necessary for time-frequency source estimate viewing and would be greatly improved by integrating them to allow for exploration of this complex data. A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to look at regions of high power spectral density, while letting the user dynamically adjust the range of frequencies, would be incredibly helpful for allowing this kind of data to be explored and analyzed. The ability to browse slices has already been implemented in `mne.gui.ieeg_locate` and could be abstracted to be used in this case. Time-frequency plotting of spectrograms, with appropriate units and baseline correction already exists in MNE-Python as well. Putting these elements together into a GUI would be a great improvement for the MNE-Python tool and community.",

It enables users to integrate Fortran code into Python easily and quickly. F2PY has been in maintenance mode since 2009, ever since it became feature-complete for Fortran 77. Beginners browsing its codebase in the current state might find it challenging to read, understand and contribute. The frontend of F2PY is a handwritten command line parser that predates the intrinsic ‘argparse’ module by several years.\n\nThis project will include modernising the CLI with the “argparse” python library, simplifying the frontend codebase and making it more developer-friendly to contribute to.\n\nSince “np.distutils” is set for deprecation, I propose adding an option to build the F2PY’s generated CPython extension modules with Meson. Meson will significantly speed up building standalone extension modules through the F2PY CLI. There is no change proposed to the process of generating C and Fortran wrappers from Fortran source files. Generation of the source code for integration in Python projects will be carried out in the same way. Currently, “np.distutils” is used by F2PY to build generated extension modules. Adding a Meson backend will provide faster builds and long-term backend support for F2PY.\n\nAdditionally, I plan to re-implement the class-based test-suite of F2PY in a modern pytest manner and add a developer’s guide to F2PY.",

Currently, a user can only show an older revision when that revision is pushed as top revision. We want to be able to use this in the asynchronously work mode.\n\n\n- show more than one flightpath on a view We have campaigns with more than one aircraft. Sometimes for example they should do in different altitudes the same pattern. Therefore we need an option to add another flightpath on a view. Also it should be possible to toggle the active state, so that it is possible to alter data. On toggling a flightpath the data table gets updated.\n\n\n- the server can use categories to filter existing flight paths. After some defined time a flightpath should be moved to inactive state to have the UI showing only current flightpaths. There should be an option for the creator to reactivate an inactive flightpath and also inactivate one.\n\n\n- invite link to operations Besides that one creator can add others to an operation, we want an option to get invited. by clicking on an invite link. For a creator, we want that different links for different roles can be created and inactivation of links should be possible.",

The purpose of this project will be to extend the measures of functional connectivity using a state-space modeling approach utilizing the observed variables (sensor measurements) to estimate functional connectivity across latent variables (neurological regions of interest). The output of this method will provide time-varying autoregressive (AR) coefficients, indicative of the connection strength between any two latent variables. The model’s output will be used to draw a directed graph as a visualization tool to understand information flow across latent variables. Statistical methods will be implemented in order to determine statistical differences between different network configurations.",

There are numerous methods, models, and algorithms for data cleaning processes that might be categorized under imputation, outlier detections, formatting, and visualizations among others. The process of evaluating these methods for a given dataset is challenging considering the volume of the dataset and the time/space complexities of the methods. Automation of the performance evaluation process can lead to a significant reduction in human efforts and time consumption with an unbiased comparison environment. \n\nThe imputeTestbench package provides a benchmarking tool for automated performance evaluation and comparison of various imputation methods for time-series datasets. In its present form, the package is capable of handling time-series and temporal datasets. Imputation plays a crucial role in the fields of genetics and genomics. The aforementioned package can be very helpful if it can be modified to handle genetic or genomics datasets. It has huge potential in handling genetic/ genomics datasets and introducing parallel-processing and high-performance computing concepts.\n\nConsidering these as a motivation, the goal of the project is to develop a new R package, modifying the imputeTestbench package for Genomics applications with better computational capabilities and will be named 'imputeTestbenchG'.",

          "description": "Shot Boundary Detection of films is an important task that is mostly performed manually. There are some available tools and existing research which tend to automate the process. However, in the case of old archival films, available tools fail to detect most of the shot boundaries. State-of-the-art research performs quite well in detecting these boundaries, but these methods come with high time complexity and are not feasible to use in real life. In this work, an efficient and accurate shot boundary detection is proposed which should work well with archival films. The proposed tool will be built upon the existing work 'FilmEditDetection', which is developed during the last summer of code. The proposed tool should be able to detect the shot boundaries, which the previous tool fails to detect, without compromising the time complexity of the entire tool. This is achieved by using a machine learning-based framework on top of the cut detection module(Siamese Network). Few new features are also to be added to the tool - Average Shot Length, Comparison of individual shot lengths, etc. The current version of the tool is based on CLI. A graphical user interface can be developed based on the tool for simplicity of use.",

          "description": "This proposal proposes a multi-modal multi-phase pipeline to tackle television show segmentation on the Rosenthal videotape collection. The two-stage pipeline will begin with feature filtering using pre-trained classifiers and heuristic-based approaches. This stage will produce noisy title sequence segmented data containing audio, video, and possibly text. These extracted multimedia snippets will then be passed to the second pipeline stage. In the second stage, the extracted features from the multimedia snippets will be clustered using RNN-DBSCAN. Title sequence detection is possibly the most efficient path to high precision segmentation for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection (which have fairly structured recordings). This detection algorithm may not bode well for the more unstructured V8+ and V4 VCR tapes in the Rosenthal collection. Therefore the goal is to produce accurate video cuts and split metadata results for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection.",

A single stream of data can contain multiple sound effects, so the model should be able to label them from a group of known sound effects like a Multi-label classification problem. The first step would be to develop a baseline model using existing pre-trained deep learning models and add to the Red Hen’s pipeline. Then the performance can be improved using transfer learning and fine tuning the existing model to achieve better accuracy. In this process, the models can be trained on sound effects from noisy or human labeled data sets after they are pre-processed to avoid acoustic domain mismatch problems.",

          "description": "The way humans interact with each other occurs in multimodality. We not only articulate words, but also we show them. Expressing different concepts such as time, place, and emotion comes with speech and some movements called body gestures. In this study, we propose a multi-modal method that captures different patterns of body gestures aligned with an articulated time expression such as \"from beginning to end\". Our proposed architecture lies on two neural networks, the Compact Transformer and the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Compact Transformer which is the current State-of-the-art structure for temporally distributed images also performs well over low-resourced data. LSTM performs well over temporal data with long-term dependencies. The hypothesis of this project is the existence of a relation between the body gestures and the time expressions we speak and using neural networks we try to accept or reject this hypothesis.",

The results from the previous algorithm are pretty similar to Paul's manually annotated spreadsheet shared by Tim. In my proposed approach, major problems with the algorithm can be solved, So I have decided to continue the show segmentation project. Some of the anchors are misinterpreted, leading us to the wrong show name. There are 2 ways to solve it by improving the boundary detection, thus improving the clustering algorithm, and using a cleaned MS-Celeb dataset. Combining both approaches will definitely enhance our boundary segmentation by up to 90%, resulting in final high accuracy in predicting show names and networks. We’ll try to finalize the segmentation project by this summer, and this should be the end of the past 5 years of quality research.",

Our goal is to detect the transition between the consecutive shots and at the same time to identify the type of cut (e.g. gradual, abrupt). Compared to the majority of the existing works, we aim to work on historical films, with damaged or low-quality video data, which makes the cuts identification task particularly challenging.

          "description": "Artificial intelligence developments can lead to growth and scientific advancement at a rapid pace making it even more important how these systems are implemented and informed to the general public in the most accessible manner. Data Cards Playbook is about bringing people together to transparently show the importance of transparency, ethics, and dataset literacy. The goal is to translate the playbook activity to be designed with users in a participatory design setting as hoped in the ACM Track 3 proposal. This is where interactive experiences on the website can add even more magic to what can be an even more powerful tool.  The goal is to turn one of the most essential, popular static activities as determined by the team and users into something interactive. This would include user research, heuristic evaluations, wireframing and designing UIs, and prototyping the product in code. Ultimately, the hope is to bring comprehensive transparency artifacts that are not only beneficial to the documentation process and stakeholders themselves but to the human-centric and responsible practices when it comes to datasets in ML applications.",

Some early limitations arising from the necessary limited dimension of sensor spaces have been overcome with the integration of DNN as efficient reducers of large input data. In this project we want to apply RL as an online method to improve an existing grasping algorithm. Using a Kinova Gen3 arm simulated in CoppeliaSIm, that already performs a pick and place operation using a gripper with multiple force and distance sensors, the goal is to improve the current grasping performance by running RL algorithms that learn from the existing algorithm and, eventually, replace it to continue is adaptation to the specificities of the environment. If the experiments proceeds as expected, a second stage will try to transfer the learned controller to the grasping of a new target object in the scene, for example, from a block to a cup. All the experiments will be performed with RoboComp’s robotics cognitive architecture CORTEX, and the tools and existing agents already developed and tested.",

The effect of this adaptation is safer, more efficient, and, possibly, better socially aware navigation.

          "description": "Switching to Conscrypt, simulating the security APIs becomes much more high-fidelity and it achieves the goal of Robolectric to make it similar to an Android environment.\n\nCurrently, Robolectric uses BouncyCastle as the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) security provider. Starting in Android P, Android switched to using Google Conscrypt as the security provider. To be more consistent with Android, Robolectric should update the default security provider to Conscrypt.\n\nAs it is using the BouncyCastle, this means that whenever the JCA APIs are used in a Robolecetric test, BouncyCastle will be used by default. Officially, In Android the default JCE provider is Conscrypt. This is a Java wrapper over BoringSSL. The goal is to have Robolectric switch from BouncyCastle by default to Conscrypt.\n\nThe Conscrypt module uses BoringSSL, a native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL and which is used in many Google products like Google Chrome for cryptography and TLS. \n \nConscrypt uses Java code and a native library to provide the Android TLS implementation as well as a large portion of Android cryptographic functionality such as key generators, ciphers, and message digests. Conscrypt is relatively selective and focuses on the most important and widely-used algorithms. \n\nConscrypt also supports the curves in Elliptic Curves crypto operations and it is much faster than BouncyCastle as it is optimized native code. But BoringSSL doesn't have official releases and makes no guarantees around API or ABI stability.",

CAN protocol is a robust, reliable and multi-master serial communication protocol used to achieve real-time message transfer between devices within the CAN network. RTEMS being a real-time operating system, CAN peripheral support would increase the potential to meet real-time demands.\n\nBBB has two CAN 2.0 A, B (ISO 11898-1) controllers with 1 Mbps data transfer rate and DMA support. It also has inbuilt RAM which can hold 64 CAN messages. There is a loopback support also, which can be used for debugging purposes. By adding driver support for CAN modules, will enable the use of this potential hardware. With the help of the Am335x reference manual, TI’s starterware firmware and CAN specification I could understand the initialization and working of the CAN module. With the help of existing RTEMS supported CAN drivers I could understand the CAN framework and develop the support for CAN modules for BBB in RTEMS.\n\nI chose this project because I started learning embedded systems from BeagleBone Black and developed firmware from scratch with few peripherals and shell support https://github.com/slpp95prashanth/Beaglebone-mBootloader/tree/cpsw. As SoC and RTEMS are open source computing platforms, I would like to contribute to this project and learn more about RTEMS operating systems.",

Documentation is of two types - 1) Documentation within the code and 2) Documentation about the code. Ruby supports the generation of documentation for a particular codebase using comments written internally in files by tools such as RDoc, and YARD. RBS is a newly developed language for describing the structure of Ruby programs. RBS, similar to Ruby, supports adding comments in the source file. Hence, this feature can be effectively utilized to write encoded inline documentation to later generate well-formatted markup documentation. RBS currently has support for a lot of features.

          "description": "Scala Native is an ahead-of-time and prevalent compiler for Scala. The traditional compilation is to compile Scala into Java Virtual Machine(JVM) bytecodes, which are executed by JVM. Scala Native compiles Scala into LLVM intermediate representation(LLVM IR) rather than JVM bytecodes. This property decreases the overhead of JVM and improves compilation performance. However, one of the most criticized aspects of Scala Native is its slow compilation efficiency and long build time, especially for large projects. Therefore, the optimization of Scala Native is urgently needed. The aim of this project is to build benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the Scala Native linker, and explore feasible solutions to accelerate the building task of Scala Native. Three aspects are going to be exploited: speeding up the optimizer, introducing incremental compilation, and changing the compilation and linking procedure. As a result, we expect to create benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Native Scala, and to reduce the build time by at least 20%.",

          "description": "Kubernetes is a great tool for container orchestration, running Kubernetes in your production environment is getting traction in the Cloud industry. With growing DevOps tools, it is now a tedious and time-consuming task SREs and developers to continuously monitor their remote applications running inside a multicluster Kubernetes environment. Though there are some great tools using which we can monitor Kubernetes tools there is a need for easy deployment setup and an alerting tool that people can use to get alerts when something goes wrong inside their application running in a Kubernetes environment. It is often time-consuming to figure out the root cause of such issues, and most importantly not all alerts and issues are important and do not need human interaction. This brings us to address the problem of out of box metrics, traces, events and logs collection for applications running inside Kubernetes, reporting all the collected data on a single dashboard and push notifications to users for critical ones. The collected metrics, traces, events and logs will help to debug the application running inside Kubernetes faster and effectively.",

Although this process should not be flooded with false positive alerts which we identified as alert fatigue. Considering processing vast amounts of boundless stream data and doing a  less false positive detection rate is a system engineering challenge that should stand side by side with cybersecurity expert knowledge.  \n \nBuilding state of the art systems required several major components divisions. There are Data Sources (IDS, sys logs, net logs, firewall logs, files) , External intelligence (IOC, SIEM), Processing and detection unit(s)  (batch or streaming processing, deployed ML/DL models) , Data storages (databases, flat files, object storages) and visualizations (index, dashboards).\n \nRecreating each of above divisions are equivalent to reinventing the wheel, therefore openXDR focuses intergaterabiltiy to work with available tools out there which leads users to use existing systems without hassle but with the power of detection and response time of openXDR.

However, metaverse software currently on the market, from Second Life to Horizon Worlds, either limit input to traditional input devices like mice and keyboards, or require expensive gear in the form of VR headsets and specialized controllers. In this project we aim at integrating interaction techniques that rely on human facial and body gestures, similar to these employed in high-fidelity telepresence systems like Google’s Starline, that we will apply to a hybrid presence system and with low-cost hardware to enable accessibility and affordability. This GSoC project aims to perform much needed research into using face tracking as a viable means to improve the accessibility of 3D virtual spaces, much like those found in the metaverse. The result benefits all users, whether or not they have specific needs for accessibility: improved interaction vectors and empathy channels liberate all users.

It supports any kind of data stream: it has been used with multichannel audio, video frames, 3D models, OSC messages, and various others types of data. Shmdata is server-less, but requires applications to link data streams using socket path (e.g. \"/tmp/my-shmdata-stream\"). Shmdata is very fast and allows processes to access data streams without the need for extra copies.\n\nHowever, permissions are not supported, and any stream shared on the system with Shmdata is accessible system-wide. The project will enable the possibility for a Shmdata user to configure streams permission using shared memory right setting at the API level.\n\nWhen sharing data between processes via shared memory, not all components of the data need to be visible to everyone. Different groups might need to access different data, furthermore, some data might only be needed to be visible to the owner of the files. In such cases, the permissions that would have to be implemented are combinations of 'read', 'write' and 'execute' permissions that would be given to the owner, group or common user(i.e. everyone else).\n\nPermissions would be 'none', 'execute only', 'write only', 'write and execute', 'read only', 'read and execute', 'read and write', 'read, write and execute' with corresponding values of 0-7 respectively.\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\n* Providing an option for users to restrict or openly share data streams via these file/ directory access modes: read, write and execute/traverse.\n\n* Changing data access permissions.\n\n* Documentation for the improvements made.\n\n* Incorporation of ACL to assist with Unix file permissions.

The solution encompasses Checking if the namespaces and license format is in accordance with the SPDX License List Matching Guidelines, v2.1, Deduplication to eliminate any duplicate licenses in the system and also converting the license information uploaded to user into a Canonical format using a Mapping function and store it in the Secure database.",

          "description": "C++ 17 and 20 released the par_unseq and unseq execution models which give guarantees to functions which specialize on them that data access functions can be interleaved even between iterations of one thread. This means that these functions are vectorization safe and can thus gain massive boosts in performance by compiler auto-vectorization. \n\nCompilers however are conservative and auto-vectorize loops only when they are sure that vectorized versions give the same result as their scalar counterparts and that vectorization will actually end up being profitable. GCC, Clang, MSVC, ICC all rely on different optimization passes in their backend and are all capable of auto-vectorizing certain loop patterns but not all.\n\nThe goal of this project is to analyze compiler codegen response to different hints and implement a version of the par_unseq and unseq execution policies in HPX that makes use of these guarantees to provide compilers with as many hints as possible to encourage auto-vectorization.",

But they have been missing coroutine (co_await) integration and minor functionalities as described in P2300 which is likely to be accepted. Hence I propose to implement these functionalities within the Core HPX Library.\n\nBenefits:\n* Coroutines introduce better async code. For example, it is more readable, local variables have the same lifespan as the coroutine which means we don’t need to worry about allocation/release.\n* S/R algorithms can work with coroutines which they cannot as of now unless relied on futures which as mentioned are single-time use.\n* Adding co_await support makes the code more structured with respect to concurrency which can also be done by library abstractions of callbacks but using co_await may make it more optimized.",

          "description": "Swift’s type inference algorithm allows us to write source code without explicit type notations. It is implemented using a type checker that breaks up the source code into subexpressions and generates their abstract type variables and type relationships to create a constraint system that maps out all of these components of the subexpressions of the source code and helps the compiler deduce the missing concrete type information from this context. These type variables, their interrelationships, and the final type-checked expressions can be printed as debug information to help compiler developers understand this process. However, the current debug output is hard to understand, wordy and repetitive, with a format that is difficult to follow. This proposal will reorganize and rewrite the debug output of the type inference algorithm to make it more human-friendly and improve the debugging experience for new and experienced Swift compiler developers.",

The swift-syntax library serves this purpose by providing a Swift representation of syntax trees, along with facilities to parse and generate Swift code.

This project also plans to add some functions to the geometry module to add some flexibility to the way one can form composite shapes so that it is easier to define complex cross-sectional geometries for the beam module.

The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. Keeping this in mind, this project attempts to develop a sophisticated diagnosing technique that will highlight the potential cancerous regions in a given ‘Prostate biopsy slide’, thereby aiding the doctors in faster and more accurate diagnosis. However, in the presence of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) (doctors, radiologists, etc.…) this task becomes trivial, but in the absence of SMEs diagnosing PCa via 'Whole Slide Images' is almost always impossible. In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is drastically underfunded and the vast majority of these countries cannot provide basic healthcare to the public. In such conditions, the availability of doctors is very unlikely. Automated analysis and classification of biopsy images without the presence of any subject matter expert is a crucial task. Thus, developing a reliable and robust system, susceptible to noise, in the form of a web app or inference engine is the project's main goal.",

          "description": "I will potentially work towards the following problems during the GSoC:\n\n1)  I am excited to implement advanced algorithms in JAX and create/re-produce demos/figures to put in textbooks. For example, recently I implemented Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) from scratch in JAX. Readers can easily connect maths with code by referring to this kind of from-scratch implementation. Also, pure JAX code can introduce some unique features of JAX such as  lax.scan() to optimize the training loop.\n\n2)  I will improve the quality of the existing figures in textbooks using a set of matplotlib configurations we use in our group for research papers. For example, In Figure 2.4 of book1, due to missing y-label, x-label, and legend, readers may find difficulty in understanding the figure. I will fill these small gaps and also improve the figure by applying latexify on them. Latexify is a function that applies latex effects by setting consistent font style, font size, and figure size with other text in the book.  For example, this gist (https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/9c5c2ee77afd495759ed1a2aad0e460e) shows an improvement of the above figure. I have already started to work on this thread and contributed by improving Figure 2.2, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, and Figure 2.15 of the book1. \n\n3) Add an Interactive demo for figures wherever applicable: I will add some interactive demos for figures so the reader can visualize the effect of variables in a particular problem. For example, figure 2.9  shows two different binomial distributions for two different θ (probability of success). I have added an interactive demo as shown in this notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/binom_dist_plot.ipynb) In above notebook readers can change θ and understand the effect of θ on the binomial distribution.",

          "description": "KerasNLP is a library for building NLP building blocks such as model layers, metrics, tokenizers, text processing/augmentation techniques, etc. I have contributed a few of these modules myself, and would like to contribute more such modules during GSoC. \n\nFirstly, I would like to contribute NLP-specific metrics. Here, I plan to implement metrics which are not present in Keras, and which are generally used for NLP tasks. Most of these metrics will be implemented as live training metrics, i.e., they can be input to `model.compile` and computed during training. Hence, the implementation should be \"in graph mode\". The metrics I wish to implement are: BLEU Score, Word Error Rate [WER], Character Error Rate [CER], CHRF, CHRF++ and BLEURT.\n\nSecondly, I wish to add functions for decoding strategies. Text Generation is an important problem in NLP. It encompasses tasks like summarisation, machine translation, story generation, etc. During inference, we need to sequentially decode the output of the encoder-decoder model. This is where these utility functions will help users. I plan to implement popular decoding strategies like Random Sampling, Greedy Sampling, Beam Search, top-k Sampling and top-p (nucleus) Sampling.\n\nI also want to add model encoder layers. KerasNLP does not aim to build complete models; it aims to build \"building blocks\" from which models can be built. Keeping this in mind, some encoder layers which I aim to implement are (these encoder layers can then be stacked up to form the complete model): Reformer and ConvBERT (or gMLP) encoder blocks.\n\n\nText augmentation means perturbing the samples in the original dataset to increase the size of the training set. This is where native text augmentation layers can be immensely useful. Backtranslation and Contextual Word Augmentation are methods which I will implement.\n\nThe above modules are explained in details in the proposal document.",

Sometimes collecting substantial amount of data is almost impossible/ extremely expensive as well incases of Low Resource Languages etc. hence Deep Learning Practitioners have moved to Data Augmentation Techniques to create synthetic data from real data. In Computer Vision the parallels are very clear for instance zooming in on an image or rotating an image retains labels in most cases however in Language wrong modifications can lead to mislabeling of data pretty quickly and hence it's much more trickier to perform Data Augmentation in these cases.\nThrough my proposal I would like to add 10 Data Augmentation Techniques most of which are Rule Based but have been used extensively in NLP literature to achieve substantial improvements. Having these Techniques as layers would make it convenient for users to add these techniques to their workflow and push models into training. Tweaking augmentations would also be less of a hassle as currently most Data Augmentation libraries don't offer seamless integration with models without writing custom code. \\\nThe 10 Techniques I plan to implement are Synonym Replacement, Random Deletion, Random Swaps, Random Insertion, Stop Word Dropout, Character Level Swap, Keyboard Typo, SentenceShuffle, Remove Duplicate Sentences and Back Translation\nAll of these techniques have been used in Heavily Cited Works making them the perfect candidates to add to the list.\nBy the end of the GSOC tenure my goal is to have these techniques fully implemented as layers with accompanying tutorials to get started with them for new users to quickly add these to their workflows once the library has a formal release.",

In Java Symbolic Pathfinder (SPF), a widely used Java symbolic executor, existing string solving integration lacks support for many string functions, including some frequently used ones. To improve SPF string solving, I will implement support for unhandled string functions based on functions that are already supported. For some functions looping on the input string, I will construct solver constraints by symbolically executing the implementation of those functions. As stretch goals, I also plan to add support to StringBuilder/StringBuffer and implement regex solver integration. The deliverable of this project is an SPF branch with most string functions supported, together with documentation and unit tests for newly supported functions.",

For example, the Julia REPL requires additional packages to display images in the REPL and is inconvenient for repeated use. Images also clog the REPL, making it more inconvenient when pre-processing data. On the other hand, notebooks lack debugging tools and waste a lot of space in their layouts.\n\nA straightforward and extensible solution that uses the REPL and customizes it to our needs can bridge this feature and convenience gap. The TermLayouts.jl project aims to add extensions to the REPL and introduce a layout in which these extensions can be moved and resized to fit the user's needs. This layout can further be customized using a configuration file.\n\nThis project will also seek to provide some essential extensions which most users would like to have.

This part involves hacking into functions in Luxor.jl\nto store/return the information of drawn paths somewhere.\nSecond - Bring in the ability to partially draw an object with the above paths at hand. Also implement functions to animate the \"creation\" of the object being shown. For example\nif the Object were a circle , the creation animation would draw an arc increasing its angle from 0 to 2Pi .\nThird - Bring in the ability to morph an Object into another.

The hybrid variant (HDS) sits in the middle in terms of accuracy and speed between DS and FDS. Since demands for the two differ according to situation, it makes sense to implement all thre versions (DS, FDS, and HDS) so that everyone interested can use the one most suitable to their situation.

          "description": "Density functional theory (DFT) is an established method to compute the electronic structure of matter, with applications ranging from the development of catalysts to the discovery of new drugs. DFT finds an approximation of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the studied system: this approximation comes to solving coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To deal with this method of simulation, the DFTK package is being developed in Julia.\nTo reduce runtime, we wish to develop the use of a local GPU to offload computations. However, the goal is to minimize the amount of code which needs to be adapted: having two different versions of the code existing at the same time (one for CPU and one for GPU) can be difficult to maintain in an open-source framework. This also makes the implementation of new algorithms difficult, and can deter newcomers from getting involved in the project. Since GPU algorithms for DFT already exist, the main challenge is to orchestrate the overall flow of data between CPU and GPU.\nWe believe expanding the DFTK package will showcase the possibilities the Julia programming language offers and bring together many different communities involved in molecular simulation.\nI aim to produce an alternate version of code of the DFTK package using GPU framework by clearly highlighting the differences with the CPU version and keeping code changes as low as possible.",

Given an initial set, modeling the uncertainty on the initial state, it aims to answer the question \"What is the set containing all possible final states?\" This question is relevant in several domains such as safety-critical applications and systems verification. Traditional approaches have mainly concentrated to convex sets, which can lead to overestimation of the final state when this is actually non-convex (so-called wrapping effect). Recently, Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes (SPZ) have been introduced as a set representation for  both convex and non-convex sets. SPZ have been shown to have a compact representation that allows efficient manipulation.\nThe goal of this project is to implement Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes in LazySets.jl and the corresponding reachability algorithms in ReachabilityAnalysis.jl for the JuliaReach organization. The final result will be a state-of-the-art (SOTA) toolbox for reachability analysis with sparse polynomial zonotopes, together with systematic benchmarks comparing our Julia implementation both to different implementations of the same approach and other SOTA approaches in reachability analysis.",

There is a huge scope of adding many more models to the package. To start with, we can add the Gamma and Inverse Gaussian regression models, and the ARIMA model for time series. Over time, more models can be added to the package.\nThere is also a scope of adding new macros to the package to make the syntax more clean. An example of this is in the fitmodel function of the package (and is explained via a code snippet in the proposal). From the documentation, it can also be seen that any model has many attributes which are computed when the fit function is called. When working on big data, it is possible that not all the attribute values are needed, so it is currently inefficient to compute every attribute. Instead, one can compute the attributes lazily, i.e as and when they are needed. Rigorous unit testing should be added to the package to ensure code correctness. Also, the package code can use a lot of help with its documentation and code coverage. All of these can be implemented using CI/CD. Finally, in its current state, the package lacks strict code conventions (like variable names, commit message rules etc). These are essential to ensure good quality code and to make the job easier for future contributors. To enforce this, linting can be added to the code along with Git hooks to enforce these conventions. Also, a well defined API should be documented for the models, so that new models can be added at ease.",

          "description": "The hardware necessary to build networks, sensors and computers of quantum nature is at its infancy. Potential quantum memories, repeaters, and switches are being researched all over the world, and the quantum hardware race has started.  Therefore, a need for efficient, functional, and accurate open-source quantum networking modelling tools has never been more imminent. Projects such as Julia’s QuantumClifford.jl enable researchers across the globe to research various aspects of quantum networking while anticipating the creation of the necessary hardware to produce laboratory experiments. They present cheap and efficient environments to start building potential switch, protocol, and network designs. \n\nIn classical computing, if one wants to protect a bit against errors, it can often suffice to represent that bit by a logical bit by repeating the data bit. Nevertheless, in a quantum setting, that type measurement is much more complex. Quantum qubit theory along with quantum noise present one of the most challenging problems that the quantum information field must overcome to become scalable and profitable: How to account for the error correction, needed due to quantum noise, in quantum gates?  \n\nSimulators, such as Julia's Clifford gate simulator, must mimic not only the behaviour of quantum noise, but also the effects of currently proposed quantum error correction codes. For this reason, this project proses a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes for Julia’s simulator of Quantum Clifford Circuits. These would include the Steane, Shor, and Toric codes, as well as other Surface and CSS quantum error correction codes.",

          "description": "Time to First Plot (TTFP) is one of the most disliked things about Julia language because it takes from seconds to minutes to produce the first output. This is caused by the underlying Just-In-Time compilation, and the current solution is to build a user system image containing pre-loaded libraries with precompiled code. However, the workflow is primarily manual, and users are forced to recompile the system image after any package update. Currently, Julia's developers work on introducing system-image-like blobs containing compiled native code for a specific package. However, both these methods compile only package-specific precompile statements by default, and the project will introduce a new package to change this paradigm. The package would collect precompile statements during normal usage of Julia and offer to recompile the system image (or blobs) once the libraries are updated. The provided images would fit the specific user's needs and contain compiled code that would not be compiled by the default.",

          "description": "Print Dialogs are one of the most used features for many people, and it is important that they stay up to date with the current print technologies (like CUPS) and be able to quickly adopt any new such upcoming technology (XYZ Cloud Printing Service). The print technology developers should also be able to fix any bugs as soon as they are found. However, since most Print Dialogs are provided natively by the GUI toolkits (and in some cases applications like LibreOffice and Chrome), this is often not the case. This is because the GUI toolkits themselves are large projects with long release cycles, and they have a lot of other similarly important things to work on.\n\nAs of current, most GUI toolkits like GTK and QT connect their Print Dialogs directly with the print technologies like CUPS which creates problems for both. Any changes made by the print technologies, be it a bug fix or a new feature release often takes a long time to show up in the print dialogs upstream due to the reason mentioned before. Similarly, the print technologies need to constantly maintain backwards compatibility since they can’t release breaking changes if the Print Dialogs have not yet implemented them. Besides this, there is also a disconnect between the two sides due to the slow-release cycles.\n\nThe Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB) introduced in 2017 by Till Kamppeter aims to de-couple the GUI from the print technologies. Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting (or any upcoming cloud printing projects) takes care of the CPD Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes. This way print technologies can react quickly and not be bound by the big GUI toolkits’ inertia.\n\n\nThis project will attempt to get CPDB into print dialogs upstream for GTK, Qt and Chrome.",

          "description": "The Problem:\n\nThere's no IAM System for Payment Hub.\n\nWhy is this a problem? \n\nAs of now, we have to deal with authenticating each user for every application. Integrating an IAM with Payment-Hub will help balance security with efficiency, giving customers quick access to their finances while barring anyone else. As other digital technologies become increasingly agile, customers become more accustomed to speed, making these considerations more critical. Also, with the rise in remote access to the system, we must have a secure way to authenticate and authorize users. If every employee had access to all data, one breached account could spell disaster for an entire Financial Organization. IAM brings in the segmentation and privilege restriction aspects which is necessary as remote access expands. The agility benefits of segmentation and digital identities make IAM the ideal solution. \n\nGoal: \n\nIntegrating an Identity and Access Management system (Anubis/Keycloak) to Payment-Hub.\n\nProject Impact:\n\nCurrently, there is no Identity manager in Payment-Hub and users are authenticated only using basic auth. Integrating an IAM System(Keycloak) with Payment Hub will have the following major impacts:\n- Single Sign-On capability: There will be unique sign-on credentials for access to any system, network or service. Keycloak can be used to integrate this.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication: It will involve two or more forms of login credentials for information access.\n- Privileged Access Management: We would be able to bound users to a set of privileges/access. This will provide a secure way to monitor access control with more visibility. \n- Securing APIs: IAM system will also help secure APIs and API Keys.\n\nDeliverables: \n\nThe deliverables are divided into three main tasks, namely,\n- Token Introspection\n- Scope Check\n- OAuth MTLS",

It will allow for a Raspberry Pi running NetBSD to take advantage of the dedicated graphics processor, which could be useful for other programs which currently use software rasterization to utilize OpenGL ES. Specifically, the project will be compatible with Mesa as-is, allowing existing programs which depend on Mesa for graphics API support to be able to support the Raspberry Pi's GPU under NetBSD. This will be solved by porting the existing driver to be managed inside a NetBSD loadable kernel module, which can be loaded at runtime when needed. When complete, this will allow for OpenGL ES programs which have been ported to NetBSD from Linux, and already utilize the GPU under Linux to similarly use the GPU under NetBSD, such as programs which can render a triangle, a teapot, and some games.",

          "description": "At the moment, Unikraft can leverage a single processor only. While there can be multiple threads (i.e., multiprogramming), no two activities actually run at the same time (i.e., multiprocessing). Unikraft introduces support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), thereby allowing it to execute code on all processors and cores of a system concurrently. This creates new challenges for synchronizing access to shared resources. On a single-processor machine synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores can consider interrupts as the only source of parallel execution. It is thus sufficient to protect a critical section of code by temporarily disabling interrupts. With SMP, however, this is no longer sufficient as other processors may access shared resources at any time.\nThe project will involve studying locking mechanisms used in modern kernels like Linux, FreeBSD, etc, improving the existing locking mechanisms in unikraft, and implementing new mechanisms such as read-write. The important part of the project will be identifying the critical sections present in the kernel and protecting these critical sections.",

Forward edge attacks (through function pointers and virtual calls) were proven to be less accessible after implementing Control-flow integrity (CFI) solutions. However, backward edge attacks easily bypass present instrumentation (Safe Stacks, canaries).\n\nUnder these circumstances, shadow stacks become more than necessary: shadow stacks are a defense mechanism that require metadata about the program’s state to enforce their policies. They protect the return value of the functions by comparing what’s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage. \n\nMy project will consist of comparing different implementations of shadow stacks with their advantages and disadvantages, crafting a compelling PR, that would perfectly fit Unikraft's vision regarding modularization and portability and a clear discussion of the overhead brought by such an approach.",

          "description": "VLC’s 4.0 redesign on the Mac has clearly seen many of the same changes as its counterpart for Linux and Windows, but with a more native-feeling UI on macOS. However, there are also hints that this UI requires some additional work before the release and that this proposal could assist with.\n\nVLC on macOS, for example, does not quite look like other macOS applications yet, though it’s obvious that this is an objective of the Mac team. Navigation does not work the same way as other AppKit applications and is structured in an unconventional manner. Additionally, there are visual divergences from the Apple HIG. The proposal contains visual examples of this.\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to assist in the redesign of the macOS UI for VLC by altering the aspects of the current implementation that clash with established human interface guidelines in macOS applications. Specifically, this proposal suggests:\n\n1. A redesign of the playlist to resemble collapsible sidebars used in other macOS applications (such as the Music app’s playlist sidebar)\n\n2. Changes to navigation elements within main views, such as the aforementioned double tab bar\n\n3. Attention to detail and ensuring visual polish (correct alignment of elements, proper use of separators and view coloration to distinguish between parts of the app\n\nLastly, the current nightly version of the VLC player lacks the ability to control playback, volume, etc. from the video reproduction window. A set of playback controls such as QuickTime’s, which are inconspicuous and relocatable, would be a great addition to VLC and would make the transition for QuickTime users seamless. There would still be opportunities here for VLC’s branding to come through, mainly with the use of accent colours.",

For instance, family pictures are not meant to be uploaded to Commons.

Hiding them allows the contributor to more easily spot pictures they might want to upload.\n3. Currently, when selecting 3 pictures, they are numbered \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Instead, please make all numbers always show the number of selected pictures, for instance, if 3 pictures are selected, they should all have the number \"3\", and be uploaded in the same order as their thumbnails are shown.\n4.

(2) Producing blog posts about my experiences with the community and the project, tutorials on what I learned, and explanations that are less technical than the proper documentation, so as to reach more people.

My project also includes working on Xfce-Terminal to introduce Profiles. Currently all settings in Xfce-Terminal are global.
